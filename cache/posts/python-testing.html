<p>
So you already worked with python testing frameworks.
</p>

<p>
The set up was already in place back then.
</p>

<p>
Now it is more than a year that I do not touch the thing and
everything is solidly gone.
</p>

<p>
Luckily I have a repo on my Github with some structure of it.
</p>

<p>
Will leverage that now, plus I will start to write some notes, such
that people that will have to collaborate with me can reference to
it.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, it will be useful for the future as well.
</p>

<p>
Plus finally it is always nice to see the things in multiple
languages. It is always the same story. By adding pieces to the puzzle
the picture becomes systematically clearer not the opposite. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgba118b6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgba118b6">Pytest vs. Unittests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgba118b6">
<p>
So basically these are the two big testing frameworks in the Python
space.
</p>

<p>
I had worked with both in the past. 
</p>

<p>
I will go with the first. This decision is not 100% thought through
decision but when you work you understand that sometimes you have to
cut corners and based on what I could quickly read online it is
sensible.
</p>

<p>
There is even the possibility of running <code>unittests</code> tests through
pytest so it makes sense to leverage on this. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org7c1318d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c1318d">Writing tests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c1318d">
<p>
So a good start is the good-practices section of the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html">official
documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read as well the following documentation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html">Reference API</a></li>

<li><a href="https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/">Python testing</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgde0f9ed" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgde0f9ed">Conventions for Python test discovery</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde0f9ed">
<p>
So basically there are two options:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Embedding the tests within a package - Tests inside of the
application code</li>

<li>Tests outside of the application code</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Update:</i> Go with the second version. It is the best. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6ca8c2b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6ca8c2b">AVOID - Tests outside of the application</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6ca8c2b">
<p>
Note that basically you have a set of disadavantages if you work
in such a way.
</p>

<p>
Among the others:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there is no 1:1 mapping among python testing and packages
modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to work this way you have to find a solution for it.
You can probably go into the direction with markers but I do
not know how much helpful this will be.
</p>

<p>
So basically the idea is to follow these conventions such that you
can properly map the modules to the tests.
</p>

<p>
That said, should you go this way you should work in the following
way, well noting the following points.
</p>

<p>
Note that in constrast to Java here the situation is much more
messy because of the python module imports and how everything
enters the <code>sys.path</code>. You can read more about it <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/pythonpath.html#import-modes">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can refer to that page in general, but use the following set up
in general as your north star:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    setup.py
    src/
	mypkg/
	    __init__.py
	    app.py
	    view.py
    tests/
	__init__.py
	foo/
	    __init__.py
	    test_view.py
	bar/
	    __init__.py
	    test_view.py
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that you need to create testing packages as in the above
(<code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>) if you have testing modules called in the same way.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf200184" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf200184">USE THIS - Tests inside of the application code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf200184">
<p>
This is a cleaner solution in the sense that it is clear which
tests belong to which modules.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    setup.py
    mypkg/
	__init__.py
	app.py
	view.py
	test/
	    test_app.py
	    test_view.py
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then quickly tests them by running:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    pytest --pyargs mypkg
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgfecc9c0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfecc9c0">Personal Conventions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfecc9c0">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org14304a3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org14304a3">Always use classes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org14304a3">
<p>
Always run your tests within classes. This will be of paramount
importance.
</p>

<p>
I will usually run tests in the following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="c1"># content of test_moduleX.py</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Test_ModuleX</span><span class="p">:</span>
	<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
	    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;this&quot;</span>
	    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="s2">&quot;h&quot;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">x</span>

	<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
	    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello&quot;</span>
	    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;check&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
then you can run the tests for the single module as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    $ pytest -q test_moduleX.py
</pre></div>

<p>
On the top of it you can as well create complex logic by
inheritance etc.
</p>

<p>
Finally it is important to realize that despite the way you set up
your tests, the following benefits are there:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Test organization</li>

<li>Sharing fixtures for tests only in that particular class</li>

<li>Applying marks at the class level and having them implicitly
apply to all tests</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can as well use the flag <code>-k</code> to run tests by regular
expression.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org26b3f7a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org26b3f7a">Some Useful commands</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org26b3f7a">
<p>
Note that you have a couple of plug-ins in pytest, depending on
what you aim to do.
</p>

<p>
You can check them as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   $ pip install pytest-html
</pre></div>

<p>
Then youâ€™re able to run tests with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   $ pytest  -html<span class="o">=</span>report.html
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5bfd3d4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5bfd3d4">Interpret Results</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5bfd3d4">
<p>
You have to understand the following options:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>f - failed</li>

<li>E - error</li>

<li>s - skipped</li>

<li>x - xfailed</li>

<li>X - xpassed</li>

<li>p - passed</li>

<li>P - passed with output</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga250d46" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga250d46">Logging</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga250d46">
<p>
It is possible to set up logging options for the tests in order to
redirect standard error and standard output to given sources as
well all of the INFO, WARNING etc. messages you will need in your
application.
</p>

<p>
You can read how to do that for the pytest module <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/logging.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep consistency I think I will rather go with a
general Logger object that I will use in my project and reference
this.
</p>

<p>
Will see in time if this strategy will be solid or not. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org128e1a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org128e1a7">Test Coverage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org128e1a7">
<p>
In order to generate your coverage reports you can use the
<code>coverage</code> library.
</p>

<p>
This is important as you can properly sleep at night, once your code
is properly covered. Meaning you have a good overview of the quality
of your code etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that this are the python native tools for making such quality
checks. SonarQube is something similar that goes into the
direction. Probably more sophisticated. Would have to check into
it. In any case it is the program that Sergio mentioned to you in
order to inspect your Java code. So might be interesting as well to
explore such that you can have a unique consistent way for
inspecting all of your code irrepsective of the language. Might be
useful as well in this sense as it will reduce the burden of
managing the entire thing. 
</p>

<p>
This should also go into your <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/done-understanding-definition-done?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4PKTBhD8ARIsAHChzRIlof8n0e1pwXTQ-QBKWB56BuHONmIqLLL99zyOrJBa57FCg3heLUUaAgkIEALw_wcB">definition of <code>DONE</code></a>, meaning you can
consider a project done just if you reach a given threshold of test
coverage. 
</p>

<p>
You will release your projects just when you will have covered a
decent coverage level.
</p>

<p>
Now you can explore the following modules in order to properly work
in here:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pytest-cov</a></li>

<li><a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.2/">coverage</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
So basically from my current understanding the second depends on the
first, i.e. it leverages on it but has some additional
functionalities such that it makes sense to go for this one. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org748f6b5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org748f6b5">Coverage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org748f6b5">
<p>
This is one of the most popular code coverage tools for Python.
</p>

<p>
I will not go through it; as mentioned I rather go with the next
library, which builds on the top of it. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga917c6f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga917c6f">Pytest-Cov</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga917c6f">
<p>
Pytest-cov is a Python plugin to generate coverage reports. So as
the above.
</p>

<p>
In addition to functionalities supported by coverage command, it
also supports centralized and distributed testing. It also supports
coverage of subprocesses.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1409503" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1409503">Usage</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1409503">
<p>
After you installed the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/">relevant library</a>, you can install
everything in the following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">pytest</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">cov</span><span class="o">=&lt;</span><span class="n">myproject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">cov</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">=.</span><span class="n">coveragerc</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
this, if you want to test a project with a structure as in <a href="#orgf200184">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>.coveragerc</code> is a configuration file where you can
specify the options for writing your tests. You might start by
reading the <a href="https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html">official documentation</a> for it. Or <a href="https://breadcrumbscollector.tech/how-to-use-code-coverage-in-python-with-pytest/">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
Recall that it is good practice to eliminate your tests files from
the coverage reports. This way you are not interested in them,
they are actually used for covering the standard source code not
the opposite.
</p>

<p>
You can do it as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    [run]
    omit = **/test/*
</pre></div>

<p>
You can specify similar options over there.
</p>

<p>
Another important flag for working with the coverage is the
following: <code>--cov-fail-under=MIN</code>
</p>

<p>
The idea is that your tests will fail if the coverage is less than
MIN. This goes a bit into <a href="#org8b40a41">this</a> direction.
</p>

<p>
All good in such a way you can create solid CI pipelines and
create a good definition of DONE.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2222e6a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2222e6a">Practical Example for the above:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2222e6a">
<p>
You can see a practical example for the above in the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nb">cd</span> c:/Dev/pythonWorkspace/relationaloperations/

    <span class="c1"># recall to activate the virtualenv with the relavant packages for the</span>
    <span class="c1"># below.</span>

    pytest --pyargs src <span class="c1"># normal pytest for the src project</span>

    pytest --cov<span class="o">=</span>src --cov-config<span class="o">=</span>.coveragerc <span class="c1"># pytest-cov </span>
</pre></div>

<p>
There you see for instance the test<sub>Testing.py</sub> module and
similar.
</p>

<p>
I will introduce here some toy examples of different ways of
testing cases.
</p>

<p>
This is a bit different in comparison to Java. There you have more
methods that already cover most of the assertion cases you might
be interested in. Say for instance assertThrows etc.
</p>

<p>
In <code>pytest</code> you simply work with <code>assert</code> statements and you twist
everything according to different flavours. Check in this sense
<a href="https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/python/python-testing/#skipping-tests">this source</a>.
</p>
</div>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org3c07613"></a>How to test that a method returns an Error<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3c07613">
<p>
In order to check at this you can use the following schema:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>     <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest</span>

     <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_Raise_Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

	<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">raises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">SyntaxError</span><span class="p">):</span>
	    <span class="n">connectionString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
			     <span class="s1">&#39;hello;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>


     <span class="c1"># The above is the general Syntax. So you see you make sure that the</span>
     <span class="c1"># value of the context is an error of the type you are expecting.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can see then how to test that a method returns a user-defined
error message as in the URL above.
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="orgf82ab50"></a>Skip and skipif<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgf82ab50">
<p>
These are two very useful methods in order to skip tests or skip
them by condition. This is quite handy. Think for instance of
skipping tests if they are below a certain version etc.
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="orgc129123"></a>Xfail<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc129123">
<p>
This is also practical. You mark such tests in such a way when
you know that they are supposed to fail.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance of having bugs in your code such that you
expect them to fail.
</p>

<p>
Then if such tests pass you will have them marked in your
reports. In such a way you know that something went wrong and you
did not obtain the expected behaviour. 
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org27d42c5"></a>Setup and Teardown<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org27d42c5">
<p>
Similar to java you can as well have modules that contain source
code to be run before or after the tests.
</p>

<p>
You can use the following in this sense:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>setup<sub>module</sub> - run once before all the test functions</li>
<li>setup<sub>function</sub> - run once before each test function</li>
<li>teardown<sub>function</sub> - run once after each test function</li>
<li>teardown<sub>module</sub> - run once after all the test functions</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org5580f45"></a>Fixtures<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5580f45">
<p>
Basically in such a way you can pass data to your tests. So I
think it goes into the direction of Mocks in order to write
tests.
</p>

<p>
You can find the way of writing such tests <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html">here</a>.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org05826f1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org05826f1"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> distributed tests</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org05826f1">
<p>
this will become important when you will have a lot of tests
covering your code.
</p>

<p>
Not so important to this stage.

<div id="outline-container-org7b39544" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7b39544">On the coverage Metrics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b39544">
<p>
Note that the above two basically report by the default the
coverage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)">statements</a> in your program.
</p>

<p>
While this is the standard it will require you to write tons and
tons of tests. So either you will go with TDD or you will likely
get poor coverage ratios such that it will be difficult to assess
from there if you tested at least the basics of your programs.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to use different metrics such as functions
coverage. The idea here is simple. Instead of checking how many
statements you did cover you can check at how many functions,
methods etc. your code did cover.
</p>

<p>
In order to go down that different road you could start to explore
other plugins as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-func-cov/">this</a>. This is a simlar plug in to the pytest
package as the coverage one.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org8b40a41" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8b40a41"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Set up your CI pipeline incorporating this bit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8b40a41">
<p>
What is a good coverage ratio?
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage#:~:text=With%20that%20being%20said%20it,fairly%20low%20percentage%20of%20coverage.">the following</a>.
</p>

<p>
Given this you see that there are rough indications with respect to
the coverage your applications should have.
</p>

<p>
The idea is then to embedd this into the CI pipeline such that if
the coverage is not reached the CI will fail.
</p>

<p>
This will be hard to achieve for existing projects. It makes
probably sense to aim for it for newly created projects.   
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org7bd5f3b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7bd5f3b"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> CI pipeline</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bd5f3b">
<p>
This does not quite much has to do with python testing etc. Will
hold it here for now as it is in the CI space.
</p>

<p>
I would eventually have to reorganize things a bit.
</p>

<p>
In any case this is necessary as it gives you visibility. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The idea is of a remainder to put badges on your projects,
i.e. with the coverage, if the thing is passing or not etc.
</p>

<p>
This would help you to gain the necessary visibility etc.

We are using bitbucket to this stage for version control.

<p>
So this is a nice automation tool. Should properly check into it and
make it run.
</p>

<p>
Note that basically the way you do it currently is manually. There
is no big difference. But might make sense to start using this in
order to work more in a streamlined way. 
</p>

<p>
I.e. you can set up virtual enviornments, package your code, run
your tests etc.

well following the best practices that these tools are imposing on

<h3 id="orgb39c660">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb39c660">
<p>
The general idea of tox is to specify all of the relevant
operations in order to standardize your workflow in a <code>tox.ini</code>
file.
</p>

<p>
Based on this, then the following workflow usually follows:

<h3 id="orgd3112d3">General Key Strengths of tox</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3112d3">
<p>
With it you can test your code against multiple versions of
python&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So that is quite handy. You see nonetheless that you do not come
out with a clean docker image you can run and properly
orchestrate.

This is quite an annoying one. You should not underestimate it.

<blockquote>
<p>
There is a danger of using a stale tox venv. One of toxâ€™s weaknesses
is its inability to track changes in the dependencies in the setup.py
and/or requirements.txt files. This is something to keep in mind.
</p>

<p>
When you have made such a change, always be sure to pass the tox -r
(recreate) flag so that the environments areâ€¦you guessed it,
recreated.

<p>
The thing is that you know about docker and the way of creating
docker images.
</p>

<p>
Well now the point is that you can package your applications as
docker images and this solves quite much of the packaging issues
you were leveraging tox for.
</p>

<p>
You can as well integrate it apparently. Not that clear what can
happen.
</p>

<p>
The question is then about how to run all of the necessary tests
before packaging your images.
</p>

<p>
For this you usually go with a solid CI pipeline. Or as a second
possibility you can investigate into <a href="https://blog.chmouel.com/2014/09/08/dox-a-tool-that-run-python-or-others-tests-in-a-docker-container/">these topics</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So use it now as your team is not on the docker road. But make sure
that if you end up in that space you adapt.
</p>

<p>
Meaning it is a good substitute in the meanwhile to move in that
space. I found this <a href="https://christophergs.com/python/2020/04/12/python-tox-why-use-it-and-tutorial/">good series</a> explaining tox in the
meantime. Here the <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherGS/tox_examples">101 repo</a> for it.
</p>

<p>
With it you should good to go to start leveraging the tool.
</p>

<p>
Especially important are the following things that you should well
understand:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As per the tox docs: â€œAt the moment tox supports three configuration
locations prioritized in the following order:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pyproject.toml</li>

<li>tox.ini</li>

<li>setup.cfg</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
I am going for the <code>tox.ini</code> one.
</p>

<p>
And the second important thing you should note is that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
skipsdist which we need to set when we are not testing a Python
package (e.g. for a service or simple set of scripts).
</p>

<p>
Anytime tox doesnâ€™t find a setup.py file this flag will need to be
set.
</p>

<p>
This is nice. You should start to learn how to do it properly.
</p>

<p>
You can start by checking at the 101 example in the repo mentioned
above.
</p>

<p>
This will be important as in such a way you can create that full
pipeline necessary to have your stack well set up.
</p>

<p>
Everything is properly set up with versions etc.

<p>
Just if you have time. 
</p>

<p>
I think this is an interesting project.
</p>

<p>
I would need more time to properly check into this.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunaltely in my current position I have no time to really go
out there and explore and push the boundaries.
</p>

<p>
It is already a miracle keeping the boat afloat and modernizing it
to the <i>current sate</i> of the technologies.
