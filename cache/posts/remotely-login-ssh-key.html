This posts outlines the way to save ssh into a virtual machine using a
generated <code>SSH-key</code>. It is very much in the spirit of the ssh keys
registration for github, for which you are referred to <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/Multiple%20SSH%20Keys%20for%20different%20accounts%20on%20a%20single%20machine/">this post</a>.

<h2 id="org25e3507">Set up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org25e3507">
<p>
The set up basically consists of generating a new pairs of <code>SSH-keys</code>.
</p>

<p>
This can be done using the shell command <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is then necessary to choose a name recognizable for the key pair
and to enter it so that you do not overwrite your other ssh-keys.
</p>

<p>
You can then copy over the generated public key say <code>id_log_VM</code> with the
command: 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ssh-copy-id -p <span class="m">3087</span> -i ~/.ssh/id_log_VM user@host
</pre></div>

<p>
This will add your public key to the authorized<sub>keys</sub> in the <code>.ssh</code>
repositories.
</p>

<p>
You might required to enter the VM password if there is one. Notice
that in the above I specified a specific port where the ssh server was
running. On the VM the SSH server was in fact running on non-standard
ports for security reasons. The idea is that if a malicious entity
might scan your host it might not be able to try to ssh into your
machine as the server is running on a non-standard port not known to
the malicious entity.
</p>

<p>
In general the port argument might however not be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Finally, from now on, you can on ssh into the VM using your ssh-keys
in the following ways:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4785d31">
$ ssh -p 3087 -i ~/.ssh/id_log_VM root@snowball.ethz.ch
</pre>
</div>
</div>
