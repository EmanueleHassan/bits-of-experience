This posts holds some memory of my time in Grenada.
</p>

<p>
First time in the Caribbean. 
</p>

<p>
Did 7 days of sailing followed by 5 days on Grenada Island. 
</p>

<p>
The sailing bit was more dynamic. The piece on the island was mainly
beach, reading and gathering of thoughts. I would like to say relaxing
but that was not it. 
</p>

<p>
It was part of my solo trip and I must admit that I am not good at
relaxing when I am by myself. I always have something on my mind and
I think I need to be around people to properly relax, which is
strange. 
</p>

<h2 id="org9ec933d">On a general impression</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9ec933d">
<p>
As was the case for the New York bit of the trip I will structure
this post in a similar way. 
</p>

<p>
I will keep some notes here about the general impression and
memories of the island. 
</p>

<p>
I will then create some parts where I will put some picture and
organize the memories. 
</p>

<p>
So talking about the general impression let's start with the sailing
part. 
</p>

<p>
And here what should I say. Fantastic there are amazing places on
this world I and really love to explore them and see them on a
boat. 
</p>

<p>
I will not go in the detail of my sailing learning and impression as I
will write a specific post for it. I want to note here though that
it was a quite different experience in comparison to my last one. I
am not sure if the boat was more comfortable - it surely was. Wider
etc. or if it was due to the structure of one charter vs. the other
but this one was feeling much more comfortable. I recall that the
mindset during the other - more intense more miles in 1/3 of the
time - was slowly changing at the end. I was feeling more as a
seaman. This time was also quite a bit about enjoying the places -
around 30 miles per day - and I must say that this type of charting
is quite for anyone and you might even do it with your more
well-habit / more city type friends.
</p>

<p>
On the note of people you met. It was nice to meet Alex. Very well
seasoned sailor and it was nice to see how different the life of
different human beings can be. I noted we lived in complete
different universes. 
</p>

<p>
He decided to frame his life around sailing. Live in contact with
nature. Sail, travel and experience the world. Settle down in
Grenada, create a family there with local people and integrate in a
complete different reality. 
</p>

<p>
I was also happy to meet Stewart a seasoned fisherman I had the
pleasure to fish with. He is a gentleman - in the true spirit of the
word - it's fun how fast you can tell actually. He is another person
that decided to leave the western society as you know it to live in
these natural paradises. First in Kenya and then when the tension
was too high he decided to move to Grenada. He never made big money
and he seemed to be struggling a bit because of that but
he seemed to be fine with it making even some humor about it. He was also in a personal
struggle when I met him as he just lost his life-partner over
covid. Wish you good luck Stewart - you left a very nice impression
on me. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, there is no such strong push for making a big career there. This is
the curse and benediction of the western society. What pushes our
western countries to their greatness and to their ruin - you can
well see it in the U.S.A. where you have just been before. 
</p>

<p>
When being on the island and around I was often recalling Charlie
Chaplin and his famous speech in <i>the great dictator</i>: "and a good
earth is rich, and has provided for everyone". Well it's funny that
you get that feeling on an island that is GDP-measured much poorer
than our western societies. 
</p>

<p>
But I think this was not simply an impression but rather a matter of
fact. There is pressure on these people; that is for sure. They also
have to make their own living and like every other people I am sure
they dream of being a great nation, more developed, more luxury,
more comfort etc. But I think that despite it they are living a
great life, the contact with nature puts the spirit at
rest. Grenadians are possibly the most friendly people I ever
met. Very open, talkative and nice. Always with a smile on their
face and in laughter mood - and this one believe me is a great bit. 
</p>

<p>
You felt safe even walking in the darkest hour alone in the streets
being clearly the "western guy". 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, that is mostly it. Regarding the second part of
trip&#x2026; nothing more to add as I see that I touched already many of
the main points in the discussion above.
</p>

<p>
The only thing I can add is maybe that I did expect it to be much
more developed in terms of resorts, touristic infrastructure,
restaurants etc. It was not and I was happy of the fact.
