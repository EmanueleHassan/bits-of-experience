So this post starts to dig into equity factor models.
</p>

<p>
Essentially you will understand how the factor models for your risk
systems are derived.
</p>

<p>
This basically goes in tandem with the fixed income risk factors
models briefly touched in your other post.
</p>

<p>
This is basically a very high level overview, on the intuition of the
way the big risk system providers generate their risk factors.
</p>

<p>
So the essential idea is always the same, get a linear approximations
for the risk based on some factors of interest.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
Equity factor models are specified for single countries (of which
there are 41 in total) plus the EMU - european monetary union - as a
single country model. On the top of it for the EMU you as well add
some specific country factors in order to make a differentiation
across the various countries.
</p>

<p>
Note that two classes of equity factors are used: <i>industry</i> and
<i>style</i> factors.
</p>

<p>
So basically the difference among the factors is roughly the
following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<i>industry factors:</i>
</p>

<p>
these represent the industry of the equity - semiconductors, pharma,
tobacco etc.
</p>

<p>
this is for sure a strong driver for the returns.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<i>style factors:</i>
</p>

<p>
on the top of it you have the relevant style factors.
</p>

<p>
these are the common factors used in the industry that checks more
the common accounting and financial properties of the academic
literature.
</p>

<p>
Say for instace:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>beta</li>

<li>yields</li>

<li>growth</li>
</ul>

<p>
etc. etc.
</p>

<p>
With the two set of factors you do then the relevant regressions on the equity
returns, in such a way you can estimate the relevant factors
mentioned above. Note that the returns are trimmed - in the sense
that they are capped in the case of too extreme returns.
</p>

<p>
There are then some quirks on how to estimate everything but this
is just computational issue that is solved by iterative methods
trying to stabilize everything.
</p>

<p>
Then apart from it everything is pretty standard and there is
nothing fancy. Just a cross-sectional regression through which you
get the factors in time and through which you can compute you
covariance matrix and simulate everything.
</p>

<p>
The only interesting bit is that you have factor loadings on that
equity model, that are estimated in a first step. Then based on this
you run your standard regression.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8e17f08">
<p>
So basically here you have already some loadings that already
capture quite some fundamental information, in the economic sense.
</p>

<p>
I.e. the loadings capture information about sales and assets in
particular industries and their relation to the values of the
companies.
</p>

<p>
In particular they give the average value/sales and value/assets
in an industry by regressing across all of the companies available.
