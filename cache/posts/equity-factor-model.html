<p>
So this post starts to dig into equity factor models.
</p>

<p>
Essentially you will understand how the factor models for your risk
systems are derived.
</p>

<p>
This basically goes in tandem with the fixed income risk factors
models briefly touched in your other post.
</p>

<p>
This is basically a very high level overview, on the intuition of the
way the big risk system providers generate their risk factors.
</p>

<p>
So the essential idea is always the same, get a linear approximations
for the risk based on some factors of interest.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
Equity factor models are specified for single countries (of which
there are 41 in total) plus the EMU - european monetary union - as a
single country model. On the top of it for the EMU you as well add
some specific country factors in order to make a differentiation
across the various countries.
</p>

<p>
Note that two classes of equity factors are used: <i>industry</i> and
<i>style</i> factors.
</p>

<p>
So basically the difference among the factors is roughly the
following.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<i>industry factors:</i>
</p>

<p>
these represent the industry of the equity - semiconductors, pharma,
tobacco etc.
</p>

<p>
this is for sure a strong driver for the returns.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<i>style factors:</i>
</p>

<p>
on the top of it you have the relevant style factors.
</p>

<p>
these are the common factors used in the financial space that checks more
the common accounting and financial properties of the academic
literature.
</p>

<p>
Say for instace:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>beta</li>

<li>yields</li>

<li>growth</li>
</ul>

<p>
etc. etc.
</p>

<p>
With the two set of factors you do then the relevant regressions on the equity
returns, in such a way you can estimate the relevant factors
mentioned above. Note that the returns are trimmed - in the sense
that they are capped in the case of too extreme returns.
</p>

<p>
There are then some quirks on how to estimate everything but this
is just computational issue that is solved by iterative methods
trying to stabilize everything.
</p>

<p>
Then apart from it everything is pretty standard and there is
nothing fancy. Just a cross-sectional regression through which you
get the factors in time and through which you can compute you
covariance matrix and simulate everything.
</p>

<p>
The only interesting bit is that you have factor loadings on that
equity model, that are estimated in a first step. Then based on this
you run your standard regression.

<h3 id="orge5f7924">Industry factors loadings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge5f7924">
<p>
So basically here you have already some loadings that already
capture quite some fundamental information, in the economic sense.
</p>

<p>
I.e. the loadings capture information about sales and assets in
particular industries and their relation to the values of the
companies.
</p>

<p>
In particular they give the average value/sales and value/assets
in an industry by regressing across all of the companies available.
</p>

<p>
So you see that these information is actually ultimately used when
processing your model.

<h3 id="orgab29444">Style factors loadings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab29444">
<p>
As mentioned these are factors that are relevant in the financial
space coming out of the financial theories.
</p>

<p>
I check next how these different things are expressed.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgf63a91a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf63a91a">Beta Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf63a91a">
<p>
Nothing new. 101 of finance.
</p>

<p>
You basically estimate the coefficients for each security across
time using a weighted regression.
</p>

<p>
Then you have your alpha and beta coefficients.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgab5e6ca" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgab5e6ca">Momentum Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgab5e6ca">
<p>
This is constructed based on two main components:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
historical alpha:
</p>

<p>
this are the alpha in time for a given security coming out
from the CAPM.
</p></li>

<li><p>
relative strength:
</p>

<p>
this is basically a proper momentum measuring the returns in
the previous tradings days.     
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
How the two are mixed up is then based on some optimization
exercise maximizing the explanatory power. This is however based
on a grid search optimization and the way the grid is initialised
is based on qualitative elements.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8f631a8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8f631a8">Earnings Yield Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8f631a8">
<p>
This loading is basically the product of thee different
statistics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>predicted</b> earnings-to-price ratio</li>

<li><b>cash</b> earnings-to-price ratio</li>

<li><b>trailing</b> earnings-to-price</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of them are given different weights when constructing such
measure. I guess that such parameters are determined in a similar
way as described in the previous sub-chapter.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org2d82d14" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2d82d14">Growth Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2d82d14">
<p>
Again a mix of different statistics. Have to understand where all
of these parameters are entered into the system.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>weighted average of long-term <i>predicted earnings growth</i></li>

<li>five-year trailing <i>earnings growth</i></li>

<li>five-year trailing <i>sales growth</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
I wonder how they compute such predictions.
</p>

<h4 id="org81a6841">Dividend-to-price Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org81a6841">
<p>
Trailing 12 month dividend yield.

<h4 id="org321270a">Book-to-price Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org321270a">
<p>

period <i>t</i>.

<div id="outline-container-org4426818" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4426818">Leverage Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4426818">
<p>
Mix of three different statistics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>weighted average of market leverage (MLEV)</li>

<li>debt-to-assets ratio (DTOA)</li>

<li>book leverage (BLEV)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you see here the classical value investment metrics a la
Graham.
</p>

<p>
You can see then in the document if you are interested how all of
these are exactly constructed. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org27cba01" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org27cba01">Liquidity Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org27cba01">

Again through classical value investing statistics.
</p>

<p>
Skipping everything for now as I do not want to get into it.

<div id="outline-container-orge2ff8a5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge2ff8a5">Size Factor Loading</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge2ff8a5">
<p>
Some reasonings around the market cap of the company.
</p>

<p>
So this measures the influence of the size of a company and
having worked for quite big companies as of now I can well
imagine why it enters as a factor.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgb4b2baf">Residual Volatilty Factor Loading</h4>

statistics.

<h2 id="org6efe3cc">Implied Volatility Factor Models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6efe3cc">
<p>
So these are used for the exotic instruments, i.e. the different
options and the mortgage backed securities.
</p>

<p>
Here basically is the usual story of using a pricing function,
invert it and get the volatility based on the observed price.
</p>

<p>
In BarraOne the dependence on <code>K_i</code> is suppressed (only
“at-the-money” implied volatilities are modelled) in which case the
problem reduces to describing the evolution of the volatility term
structure <code>σ_i (t, T_i)</code>.
