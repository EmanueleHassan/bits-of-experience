<p>
So today I was officially told that I will not get any job at IBM.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
It is a pity.
</p>

<p>
The issue and what gets under your nerves is that you failed without
any apparent reason. This is what leaves a bit the bitter taste in the
mouth.
</p>

<p>
You did work hard. You never gave up, even after all what you have
been through in the last year. This epilogue is quite harsh.
</p>

<p>
The thing that I cannot understand is that in comparison to other
people they hired for that position I was quite over-qualified. So
what can be the issue?
</p>

<p>
You got no explanation. They pretend that this is normal but it is
not.
</p>

<p>
I also have this manager. I like him a lot and he acts in a polite way
but I did not like the transparency they showed in the last months.
</p>

<p>
What does he really think? It is not nice when you get so little
feedback. It kills you.
</p>

<p>
Is he protecting me and is it his way to say go out and make your way
outside as this is dead business and for the skills you have it does
not help to keep you here?
</p>

<p>
It might also well be given the poor condition the company is in. He
also knew that I was not too interested in technical sales but it was
a good position&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Anyways, it is how that is. There is nothing you can do for it now.
</p>

<p>
My mum used to tell me that sometimes a door closes and a bigger one
opens.
</p>

<p>
The question now is: how can you learn your lesson out of it?
</p>

<p>
Well first of all think in positive terms. You are to young to get
acid blood. It might in fact be good to get burned at work at such a
young age. You will learn your lesson out of it and you will be ready
to start your career in a new company in a more mature way having
experienced such a situation.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, take it as a gift rather than else.
</p>

<p>
Once you did this first step you have to understand the following such
that you will not make the same mistake again - after all <i>errare
humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum</i>.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is momentum in the companies. There are shifts happening. You
have to understand them in due time. People say you are based on
skills and qualifications. That is not the case. It is all about
how smart you are. How well you manage politics within a
company. How you fast you can network with others. Of course how
well you work does have an impact. You will get more opportunities
through it. But that is all. And between that and the realization
of the opportunity there is an ocean as you learned at your own
skin expense.</li>

<li>Follow standard tracks. That is also interesting. You did now 2
years of work experience that nobody is willing to pay for. You get
more interviews through it but once you are seen as a
professional - as it happened to me now - then you are on par with
others professional workers and guess what they prefer full-time
professional with a higher title if they have to pay for it. So you
end up to sell yourself as a graduate student. Getting more
interviews and jobs opportunities but still no-one recognize the 2
years as real work experience. Anyways that helped a lot to pose
some milestones and I think that long term I should benefit from it
so should be ok - but monitor that in time.</li>

<li>Don't get too attached to people. They are all doing their
interests at the end on the work place. It is fierce
competition. You always acted correctly and were always very kind
to everyone but you should not trust blindly anymore in the
workspace. You did it now and you were hurt. So start to be more
pragmatic and keep more distance - especially from your
manager. Otherwise you will start to get a blurry image and will
not see things clearly anymore.</li>
</ol>


<p>
I think <i>that's all folks</i>. Take care in any case and go for the next
challenge.
