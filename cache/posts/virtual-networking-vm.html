<p>
The idea of standard vSwitches is to connect your VMs leveraging a set
virtual switches.
</p>

<p>
A standard switch works like a physical Ethernet switch. It detects
which virtual machines are logically connected to each of its virtual
ports and uses that information to forward traffic to the correct
virtual machines. A standard switch can forward traffic internally
between VMs within the same ESXi host, between VMs on different ESXi
hosts, and between VMs and physical machines, and can link to external
networks.
</p>

<p>
The virtual switches will then eventually connect to uplinks
ports. These will in turn connect to physical adapters (physical NICs)
that will then connect to the underlying physical switch.
</p>

<p>
The connection between uplink ports and the physical adapters is then
managed via physical network adapters, which are essential physical
ethernet adapters which bridges between the virtual and physical network.

<p>
<i>Uplink ports:</i> These are ports associated with physical adapters,
providing a connection between a virtual network and a physical
network. Physical adapters connect to uplink ports when they are
initialized by a device driver or when the teaming policies for
virtual switches are reconfigured. The essential idea is the
following: As with a physical switch, Layer 2 frames enter and exit a
vSwitch. As with a physical switch, a vSwitch has ports organized into
port groups. As with a physical switch, a vSwitch has uplink
ports. These are physical network adapter ports <b>found within the ESXi
host</b>, and connect the virtual switch within the ESXi host to a
physical switch.
</p>


<p>
<i>Uplinks:</i> Physical Ethernet adapters serve as bridges between virtual
and physical networks. In VMware Infrastructure, they are called
uplinks, and the virtual ports connected to them are called uplink
ports.
