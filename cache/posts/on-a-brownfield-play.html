So this post is about playing on brown-fields.
</p>

<img src="../../images/brownfield.gif" class="center">

<p>
This should become one of the most important posts that you will
develop in your professional experience.
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
I think that people that worked on serious software projects that goes
a little bit beyond the calssical chatting level or idealist
discussion will agree on that: software projects are nasty. And here
my strong claim - software projects that are long lived are the most
nasty among them all.
</p>

<p>
Funnily enough, it is much easier - and <b>satisfying</b> - to develop a
solution from scratch, even if a pioneering solution, than to start
dealing and <b>entering as an outsider</b> in a long lived project.
</p>

<p>
This is my new life. I am lucky to like challenges, cause otherwise it
would not be fun at all. But I was - by will or not - well tempered so
far in this dimension so I am happy to embrace a new challenge.
</p>

<p>
So this post sets a little bit of context for the claim above and will
make the way for successfully dealing with these kind of projects -
the most easy to fail.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6b00dfd">
<p>
Playing on brownfields that developed across decades is hard.
</p>

<p>
This is biggest discovery I made that far in my new job experience.
</p>

<p>
Not only because getting an understanding of the system is a highly
demanding task, but as well because the major stakeholders involved
in the system may not be open from scratch to the discussion.
</p>

<p>
They know the difficulties relating to the system, they have the
ownership and what happens is often that they percive a different
vision on the system as a threat or as an annoyance and therefore
you have to well manage people and expectations.
</p>

<p>
I think that a different vision on a system is physiological.
</p>

<p>
We all are bounded from our experiences in the world. Therefore, it
is normal that an external person first approaching a new system
will see it through the lenses of his personal experience, while the
stakeholder of the system that perhaps work on it since ages will
see things in a radical different way.
</p>

<p>
When entering a brownfield or a new system with some background into
other systems there will therefore be a natural tension that has to
be channeled in the correct way. The person entering the system has
to bring in his perspectives, well respecting the status quo and the
domain knowledge of the key-figures responsible for the system,
while the key-figures responsible for the system have to understand
the natural difficulty of the new joiner and paving the way.
</p>

<p>
So focus your energies on that activity. Do not hurry up entering
the system. It is okey to take a bit more of time at the beginning
in order to set the correct coorperation ground.
</p>

<p>
Keep this lesson in mind for the future - no matter on which side of
the table you will sit. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org51e5a71" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org51e5a71">On the coming and leaving</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51e5a71">
<p>
So the major issue of brownfield systems is that they are developed
across time, with a different set of technologies. These are very
long-lived projects, meaning that they were somehow successful and
managed to evolve and adapt to the client needs in time.
</p>

<p>
What happens in these systems is though the fact that key
stakeholder developing the system change. Entering as an external is
then difficult, you may not be able to appreciate why a system was
designed in a particular way.
</p>

<p>
Where did it already fail? Where it succeeded? What its pain points
are, what can be improved an what cannot or should not be touched.
</p>

<p>
This is the reason why an important communication among existing
stakeholder and new joiner is fundamental.
</p>

<p>
The issue is though the fact that at times such stakeholders do not
exists. They already left the company or the project and you might
not refer back to their knowledge pool.
</p>

<p>
This is the curse of the IT world where many companies have declared
IT systems as non-essential in the past decades outsourcing the IT
solutions deployment to consultancy companies - where the product
lifecycle of the solution is fundamentally constrained and the
entire knowledge of a solution is gone as soon as the solution is
declared to be "completed" by both parties.
</p>

<p>
Next time you need to adapt the system or as soon as your system
specifications need to change you are basically screwed and have to
start from scratch.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb7b86c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb7b86c6">On the general opinion - throw it away and start from scratch</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb7b86c6">
<p>
So this one I heard multiple times. I do not agree on this one that
far but let's see how the perception will develop in the long-run.
</p>

<p>
So basically, many people are of the opinion - keep a system running
as long as it can run - then do not waste time on playing on that
brown field. Tear it down and start from scratch.
</p>

<p>
I think it is a very poor practice to work in such a way. You would
loose all of the mental process that led to the status quo. You
would not learn from the existing solution even if breaking this
apart is a very costly and painful game.
</p>

<p>
I think this also depends a bit on the system you are working
with. Of course if your work on a system that was abandoned and not
continuously maintained by a serious team across time you might have
no option than the hard way of tearing everything down and building
it new.
</p>

<p>
But if you work continously on it I think that there the option to
indeed insists on the old system and transform it iteratively might
be a good solution.
</p>

<p>
I think it is interesting in this sense a thing.. I was just
thinking about the construction and infrastructure world. There you
destroy buildings at some point and start from scratch&#x2026; why that?
I think it is also cultural&#x2026;. in italy there you have very old
buildings. They look nice and make the cities very beautiful to
watch&#x2026; would be interesting to read some book about these concepts
in that dimension and make the bridge with IT. Would be a fun way to
switch - learn about a new segment and make bridge and understand
story lines from an industry that is present in our world for much
longer than the software industry. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, in your position is a you are in the second case. You have
the possibly to focus on a single system now for a longer time
period and make it yours, interiorizing the system and understanding
all of the difficulties of developing a strong system. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org46b6a24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org46b6a24">On the alternative - pattern up or surrender</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46b6a24">
<p>
So given the fact that you want to build up on the existing system
and that should be your go-to solution whenever possible the
question is: <i>how do you play in this brownfield environment
maximizing your chances of success?</i>
</p>

<p>
The solution lies in the title of this section. Pattern up.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that you do not have the knowledge yourself to work in
an unsrtuctured way and succeed in the task. That would require
years of experience such that you would have eventually developed a
strong sense of systems in order to reach by impulse the correct
decision and understanding of the key issues and decisions within a
system.
</p>

<p>
So when you are in such situations you go and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">ask help to your
giants anchestors</a>.
</p>

<p>
So the solution is to use the patterns they developed to deal with
such cases.
</p>

<p>
You can start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)">with this entry</a> in this sense.
</p>

<p>
Moreover you should read books they have written stating their
conclusions, such that you have a condensed learning experience
learning from their stories.
</p>

<p>
You have this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">second read</a>.
</p>

<p>
And in time you will hopefully learn to stand on their shoulders,
tackling brown-fields until you will be seen as a giant yourself.
