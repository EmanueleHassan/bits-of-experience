When deploying an application an important choice is where to run
it. In general there is a ongoing fight among <code>NGINX</code> and <code>APACHE</code>
servers. This are two kind of web-servers that handle your
application and the users requests.

<p>
On top of it there is the possibility to run an WSGI server. This 
is in fact an added layer of architecture being responsible for the
communication between the web-server and your python runtime. This is
an interface that was especially developed for running Python
applications and was necessary as traditional webservers had no means
to run Python applications.
