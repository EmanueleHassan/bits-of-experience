<p>
Through this post you will gain a bit of vocabulary in the Java
world.
</p>

<p>
This in the sense that you will understand better the deployment of
application. Server side operations etc. for the Java world.

<h2 id="orgf771a4a">Java Application</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf771a4a">
<p>
This section answers the question: how are the bytecode, the relevant
static front-end files etc. bundled?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgce1a775" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgce1a775">On WAR</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgce1a775">
<p>
A WAR (web application archive) file is used to bundle web
components, compiled classes, and other resource files like
deployment descriptors, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Together
they form a web application.
</p>

<p>
To run a Java web application, the WAR file needs to be deployed to
<b>the server environment</b>, a web container.
</p>

<p>
The web-app server can be any of Tomcat or Jetty or a Java EE
server such as JBoss or Glassfish.
</p>

<p>
Note that in simple words you can say the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A war file is a special jar file that is used to package a web
application to make it easy to deploy it on an application
server. The content of the war file must follow a defined
structure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Recall the following strucutre. <code>.jar</code> is just part of the entire
system. Can be a package dependency, a bytecode app etc. <code>war</code> is
the entire bundle.
</p>

<img src="../../images/strucutre.png" class="center">

<p>
So your app is deployed as <code>.war</code> and underneath you might refer to
<code>.jar</code> that package your libraries.
</p>

<p>
It is important always to understand where your packaged libraries
are stored on your file system. In such a way it will be possible
for you to understnad the dependency structure and see if your
build and deployment well functioned.
</p>

<p>
In this sense refer to your notes about gradle, as like this is
possible to start to connect the dots.

<div id="outline-container-orgc7eddc3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc7eddc3">Jakarta Servlet</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc7eddc3">
<p>
A java servlet simply stores a class in Jakarta EE that is conform
to the specifications of the servlet API. This is simply a standard
for responding to requests.
</p>

<p>
That is basically it. Nothing fancy.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a software developer may use a servlet to add dynamic content
to a web server using the Java platform. The generated content is
commonly HTML, but may be other data such as XML and more commonly,
JSON. Servlets can maintain state in session variables across many
server transactions by using HTTP cookies, or URL mapping. (wiki)
</p>

<p>
So again it is a very standard thing. Nothing new under the
sun. Don't just be scared of the names.
</p>

<p>
The only thing is that is the general concept. And that general
concept must be embedded into the entire ecosystem with the
different web-containers etc.
</p>

<p>
Interesting would then be to understand how frameworks fit in this
picture. Do they implement the Servlet <i>under the hood</i>?
</p>

<p>
Note as well that now the historic Servlet API has been replaced by
two different technologies - I guess two different set of specific
API albeit wiki does not specify - :
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON
and REST services</li>

<li>Jakarta XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6622176" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6622176">On web-container and Java</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6622176">
<p>
A web-container - also called web-servlet - is the component of a
web-server that interacts with Jakarta Servlets. (wiki)
</p>

<p>
It is essentially the <b>component (!)</b> of a <b>web server</b> that interacts with
the servlets. The web container is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and
ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access rights.
</p>

<p>
Now again nothing new under the sun, Tomcat is the cousin of wsgi
or something very close to it. The idea of it in the python world
was discussed <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/wsgi-apache-and-nginx/">here</a>. You can read about the top 5 open source
web-servers <a href="https://opensource.com/business/16/8/top-5-open-source-web-servers">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
So do not be confused, it is the servlet component, not the whole
webserver in itself. I have to well understand in this sense if it
is still used in combination with a more robust server such apache
or ngnix or what. 
</p>

<p>
In any case the post above mentions that you can use the coyote
extension for Tomcat and serve the role of a web-server, i.e. you
would have Tomcat not simply handling <b>Java applications</b> but as
well serve static content etc..
</p>

<p>
In any case you got the basic idea. With the servlet bit you
execute the server side java classes answering the requests
according to the well defined API. Note as well that this goes hand
in hand in the java world with the JSP Pages, which is basically
the MVC framework etc. and the way you create dynamic content.
