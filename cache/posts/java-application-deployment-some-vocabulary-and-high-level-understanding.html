<p>
Through this post you will gain a bit of vocabulary in the Java
world.
</p>

<p>
This in the sense that you will understand better the deployment of
application. Server side operations etc. for the Java world.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org647bd0e">
<p>
This section answers the question: how are the bytecode, the relevant
static front-end files etc. bundled?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbaacf0c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbaacf0c">On WAR</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbaacf0c">
<p>
A WAR (web application archive) file is used to bundle web
components, compiled classes, and other resource files like
deployment descriptors, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Together
they form a web application.
</p>

<p>
To run a Java web application, the WAR file needs to be deployed to
<b>the server environment</b>, a web container.
</p>

<p>
The web-app server can be any of Tomcat or Jetty or a Java EE
server such as JBoss or Glassfish. - in order to understand the
differences among the many <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/wsgi-apache-and-nginx/">check at this</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that in simple words you can say the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A war file is a special jar file that is used to package a web
application to make it easy to deploy it on an application
server. The content of the war file must follow a defined
structure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Recall the following strucutre. <code>.jar</code> is just part of the entire
system. Can be a package dependency, a bytecode app etc. <code>war</code> is
the entire bundle.
</p>

<br>
<br>
 <img src="../../images/strucutre.png" class="center">
<br>
<br>

<p>
So your app is deployed as <code>.war</code> and underneath you might refer to
<code>.jar</code> that package your libraries.
</p>

<p>
It is important always to understand where your packaged libraries
are stored on your file system. In such a way it will be possible
for you to understnad the dependency structure and see if your
build and deployment well functioned.
</p>

<p>
In this sense refer to your notes about gradle, as like this is
possible to start to connect the dots.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgbf8aeca">More thorough notes on .war structure</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbf8aeca">
<p>
<i>Update 21/03/22:</i>
</p>

<p>
So I am starting to connecting the dots. I had a very good session
with Sergio where we could understand a little bit better the
current set up. Check at the end of this section. You will start
to understand a couple of things. 
</p>

<p>
I had to spend a little bit more time on the understanding of the
general java deployment set up. That is important as if you miss
that one you will never be able to call yourself a java developer.
</p>

<p>
So basically the idea is to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-java-4th/9781449372477/ch15s03.html">look at the following</a>. Below just a
couple of notes based on it. You might refer to the url directly. 
</p>

<p>
Understand that one of the most important bit of the packaged java
applications is the <code>web.xml</code> file. This tells the server what to
run and how to run it.
</p>

<p>
You can inspect the structure of a <code>.war</code> through the <code>jar</code> tool.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    jar tvf shoppingcart.war
</pre></div>

<p>
When you build in gradle this should create one of such war
files. When deployed the <i>name of the war</i> becomes the <i>root path</i> of
the web-applicaiton.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The WEB-INF directory (all caps, hyphenated) is a special
directory that contains all deployment information and application
code. This directory is protected by the web server, and its
contents are not visible to outside users of the application, even
if you add WEB-INF to the base URL.
</p>

<p>
The WEB-INF directory also contains the <code>web.xml</code> file.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The WEB-INF/classes and WEB-INF/lib directories contain Java class
files and JAR libraries, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory is automatically added to the
classpath of the web application, so any class files placed here
(using the normal Java package conventions) are available to the
application.
</p>

<p>
After that, any JAR files located in <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> are appended to
the web app’s classpath (the order in which they are appended is,
unfortunately, not specified). You can place your classes in
either location.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless what is standard is that your source code goes into
<code>WEB-INF/classes</code>, while the libraries you work with will be
packaged into <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note now the following bit:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It’s also possible to install JAR files directly in the servlet
container to make them available to all web apps running on that
server. This is often done for common libraries that will be used by
many web apps. It’s also possible to install JAR files directly in the
servlet container to make them available to all web apps running on
that server. This is often done for common libraries that will be used
by many web apps.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above is important in order to understand what is happening in
our case. Cause that is the current situation. A big, fat
web-server with a big chunck of libraries that are installed there
in the <code>lib/xtra</code> etc. that are used across application.
</p>

<p>
This has as well the following issue:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The location for placing the libraries, however, is not standard and
any classes that are deployed in this way cannot be automatically
reloaded if changed—a feature of WAR files that we’ll discuss later.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which is the thing that is disturbing the developer team quite
much.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf8a036f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf8a036f">web.xml working</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf8a036f">
<p>
The web.xml file is an XML configuration file that <i>lists servlets
and related entities to be deployed</i>, the relative names (URL
paths) under which to deploy them, their initialization
parameters, and their deployment details, including security and
authorization.
</p>

<p>
For most of the history of Java web applications, this was the
only deployment configuration mechanism.
</p>

<p>
However, as of the Servlet 3.0 API, there are additional
options. Most configuration can now be done using Java
annotations. - This is how you are used to work with.
</p>

<p>
So check online at the url described above if you want to go in
the details. You might have to at some point as you are working
with legacy code. Would not surprise me if the entire structure of
the endpoints would be actually defined over there.

<div id="outline-container-org5810a4d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5810a4d">On reloading web apps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5810a4d">
<blockquote>
<p>
All servlet containers are supposed to provide a facility for
reloading WAR files; many support reloading of individual servlet
classes after they have been modified.
</p>

<p>
Reloading WARs is part of the servlet specification and is
especially useful during development. Support for reloading web
apps varies from server to server.
</p>

<p>
Normally, all that you have to do is drop a new WAR in place of
the old one in the proper location (e.g., the webapps directory
for Tomcat) and the container shuts down the old application and
deploys the new version.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So this is generally what happens when you build your webapp
through gradle and the ultimate way why you do not have to stop
the web container and start it again.

<div id="outline-container-org4e4782e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4e4782e">So understand that unorthodoxy with the packaged libraries</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4e4782e">
<p>
They are in the webapps directory in tomcat.
</p>

<p>
So either then the libraries there are added to the classpath
manually or by default tomcat inspects all of the files in the
<code>webapps</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is an open question I will not dig further for now. I will
ask for more info at the right moment.     
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1f5e6f6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1f5e6f6">Jakarta Servlet</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1f5e6f6">
<p>
A java servlet simply stores a class in Jakarta EE that is conform
to the specifications of the servlet API. This is simply a standard
for responding to requests.
</p>

<p>
That is basically it. Nothing fancy.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a software developer may use a servlet to add dynamic content
to a web server using the Java platform. The generated content is
commonly HTML, but may be other data such as XML and more commonly,
JSON. Servlets can maintain state in session variables across many
server transactions by using HTTP cookies, or URL mapping. (wiki)
</p>

<p>
So again it is a very standard thing. Nothing new under the
sun. Don't just be scared of the names.
</p>

<p>
The only thing is that is the general concept. And that general
concept must be embedded into the entire ecosystem with the
different web-containers etc.
</p>

<p>
Interesting would then be to understand how frameworks fit in this
picture. Do they implement the Servlet <i>under the hood</i>?
</p>

<p>
Note as well that now the historic Servlet API has been replaced by
two different technologies - I guess two different set of specific
API albeit wiki does not specify - :
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON
and REST services</li>

<li>Jakarta XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orga1eb03d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga1eb03d">On web-container and Java</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga1eb03d">
<p>
A web-container - also called web-servlet - is the component of a
web-server that interacts with Jakarta Servlets. (wiki)
</p>

<p>
It is essentially the <b>component (!)</b> of a <b>web server</b> that interacts with
the servlets. The web container is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and
ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access rights.
</p>

<p>
Now again nothing new under the sun, Tomcat is the cousin of wsgi
or something very close to it. The idea of it in the python world
was discussed <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/wsgi-apache-and-nginx/">here</a>. You can read about the top 5 open source
web-servers <a href="https://opensource.com/business/16/8/top-5-open-source-web-servers">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
So do not be confused, it is the servlet component, not the whole
webserver in itself. I have to well understand in this sense if it
is still used in combination with a more robust server such apache
or ngnix or what. 
</p>

<p>
In any case the post above mentions that you can use the coyote
extension for Tomcat and serve the role of a web-server, i.e. you
would have Tomcat not simply handling <b>Java applications</b> but as
well serve static content etc..
</p>

<p>
In any case you got the basic idea. With the servlet bit you
execute the server side java classes answering the requests
according to the well defined API. Note as well that this goes hand
in hand in the java world with the JSP Pages, which is basically
the MVC framework etc. and the way you create dynamic content.
