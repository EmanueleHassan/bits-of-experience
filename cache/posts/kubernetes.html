<p>
A strong orchestrator tool that operates above the container level and
allows to manage a cluster to handle containers.
</p>

<p>
It is essentially the tool set that lets you manage containers.
</p>

<p>
Enterprises can use it to manage the life cycle of containerized apps
in a cluster of nodes, which is a collection of worker machines such
as virtual machines (VMs) or physical machines.
</p>

<p>
In general kubernetes try to leverage clusters in order to avoid
having a single point of failure.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
Note that in the world of Kubernetes the terminology of the cluster is
slightly different to the one of Big Data.
</p>

<p>
While the virtual machine controlling other VMs is called master VM,
the other are not called <i>workers</i> but rather <i>nodes</i>.

<h3 id="org7b76e64">Architecture</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b76e64">
<p>
The kubernetes architecture is rather simple. It consists of three major components:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Docker running on a subnet:</b> this is the service used to run
encapsulated container applications. Important is however to notice
that the Docker service must run on a subnet <i>(available to each
node server</i>.</li>

<li><b>Kubelet Service</b>: this communicates with the master components and
receive commands and work.</li>

<li><b>Kube-Proxy Service</b>: this forwards requests to the correct containers,
balances the load and makes sure that the isolated networking
environment is predictable and accessible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In a more structured way we can say that there are multiple <i>Pods</i>
available carrying multiple containers, managed by the <i>Docker
Engine</i>, within them. These <i>Points of Delivery</i> are modules of
network, compute, storage bundled with the docker application
containers that work together to deliver networking services.
</p>

<p>
The Kube-proxy will then redirect network traffic into one of the
various Pods.
</p>

<p>
Kubelet is an agent responsible to communicate with the master what
happens at node level. For this reason you will find a Kubelet for each
node. If a Pod goes down than it is for instance responsibility of the
Kubelet to communicate this so the master. This will then be
responsible for restarting the Pod.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5b7df60" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5b7df60">Master</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5b7df60">
<p>
Masters are responsible for an entire cluster, they are the one that
makes the decision on which node to schedule an application.
</p>

<p>
The master has multiple components, all under the umbrella of a single
<i>control plane</i>.
</p>

<p>
The main component is the API server. API server manages scheduling
that goes through the REST services. 
</p>

<p>
Three other important components are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the <i>Scheduler</i>, that interacts with the API server scheduling
piece but can as well interact directly with REST services. It
determines where to host new Pods in the cluster. This furthermore
coordinates with the Kubelet in order to determine the location of
the Pods based on the load.</li>

<li>the <i>Replication Controllers</i>: these handle the replicas through the
API services.</li>

<li>the <i>etcd</i>: manages state. It is the database of kubernetes. It
tells kubernetes who is available and what the state of all these
available things is.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6866abc">
<p>
The question that arise now is how do we specify the Master the tasks to be scheduled?
</p>

<p>
The answer to the question is a <i>YAML</i> file. Here the desired state
for our application is specified and once fed to the Master the latter
will make sure the state is guaranteed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org40ae71c">
<p>
Helm, the Kubernetes native package management system, is used for
application management inside an IBM Cloud Private cluster. The Helm
GitHub community curates and continuously expands a set of tested and
preconfigured Kubernetes applications. Clients use the management

<p>
Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your
containerized applications on top of it. 
</p>

<p>
To do so, you create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration. The
Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of
your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes
master schedules mentioned application instances onto individual Nodes
in the cluster.
</p>

<p>
<i>Step 1: Create a Deployment</i>
</p>

<p>
As a first step it is necessary to create the necessary deployment by
providing a name for the deployment and uploading the docker image of
interest you want to run on top of it.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
</pre>

<p>
You can then double check the successful creating of the deployment by running:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ kubectl get deployments
</pre>

<p>
Notice the following outputs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The READY column shows the ratio of CURRENT to DESIRED replicas</li>

<li>CURRENT is the number of replicas running now</li>

<li>DESIRED is the configured number of replicas</li>

<li>The UP-TO-DATE is the number of replicas that were updated to match the desired (configured) state</li>

<li>The AVAILABLE state shows how many replicas are actually AVAILABLE to the users</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once the application is deployed it is possible to interact with it
through an kubernetes API endpoint.
</p>

<p>
This is necessary as pods that are running inside Kubernetes are
running on a private, <i>isolated network</i>. By default they are visible
from other pods and services within the same kubernetes cluster, but
not outside that network. The API overcomes such a barrier and allows
to communicate with the application system wide.
</p>

<p>
The kubectl command can create a proxy that will forward
communications into the cluster-wide, private network.  
</p>

<p>
We now have then <i>a connection between our host</i> and the Kubernetes
cluster. The proxy enables <i>direct access</i> to the API from the host
(the <b>terminal</b> in our case).  In order to do so it is possible to run
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl proxy
</pre></div>

<p>
Once the proxy is running it is possible to get the name of the host
that have access to the API by running a <code>curl</code> command as
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ curl http://localhost:8001/version
</pre></div>

<p>
Important is moreover to understand that the API server will then
automatically create an endpoint for each <i>Pod</i> so that it is possible
to communicate directly through the specific <i>Pod</i> through your proxy.
</p>

<p>
You can get a list of running Pods by running the following command
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl get pods
</pre></div>

<p>
To save the pod name you can run
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template &#39;{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{&quot;\n&quot;}}{{end}}&#39;)
</pre></div>

<p>
Once the name of the pod is there you can interact with and access the
app deployed on it by leveraging your proxy.
</p>

<p>
You can then make a <code>curl</code> query of the form
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## where the $POD_NAME has to be previously saved as above.
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/proxy/
</pre></div>

<p>
Recall that a a Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and
can contain different application containers which are relatively
tightly coupled. For example, a Pod might include both the container
with your Node.js app as well as a different container that feeds the
data to be published by the Node.js webserver. The containers in a Pod
share an IP Address and port space, are always co-located and
co-scheduled, and run in a shared context on the same Node.
</p>

<p>
Pods are the <b>atomic unit</b> on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a
Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers
inside them (as opposed to creating containers directly). Each Pod is
tied to the Node where it is scheduled, and remains there until
termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. In case of a
Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in
the cluster.
</p>

<p>
You can moreover get more specific information about each running pod by running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl describe pod
</pre></div>

<p>
Notice moreover that it is possible to see standard output of an
application running within a pod by inspecting the logging record
within that Pod.  <i>This is possible as anything that the application would normally send to STDOUT becomes logs for the container within
the Pod. We can retrieve these logs using the kubectl logs command</i>
</p>

<p>
You can inspect such by running 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl logs
</pre></div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfd4e124" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfd4e124">Direct operating within a <i>Pod</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfd4e124">
<p>
Notice that as a Pod is used as a running isolated environment within
a node it is possible to directly operate on it.
</p>

<p>
This is possible through the API given the name of a specific running Pod. 
</p>

<p>
For instance to run a bash session on the Pod it is possible to run:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME bash
</pre></div>

<p>
This will open a proper bash session within the specified Pod.
</p>

<p>
We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up
and running. For this, we use the exec command and use the name of the
Pod as a parameter. Let’s list the environment variables
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3bb0503" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3bb0503">On Pod Lifecycle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bb0503">
<p>
Up to know we have addressed the issues of accessing Pod locally from
the kubernetes CLI.
</p>

<p>
When we want to expose an application to the <i>"outside world"</i> we need
however to be careful. In order to see that think of the kubernetes
lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
Kubernetes Pods are mortal. Pods in fact have a lifecycle. When a
worker node dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost. A
ReplicaSet might then dynamically drive the cluster back to desired
state via creation of new Pods to keep your application running.
</p>

<p>
This is in fact the strength of Kubernetes as an orchestration tool.
</p>

<p>
Consider now an image-processing backend with 3 replicas. Those
replicas are exchangeable; the front-end system should not care about
backend replicas or even if a Pod is lost and recreated. That said,
<i>each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address</i>, even Pods on
the same Node, so there needs to be a way of automatically reconciling
changes among Pods so that your applications continue to function.
</p>

<p>
A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set
of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose
coupling between dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML
(preferred) or JSON, like all Kubernetes objects.
</p>

<p>
<i>Example of a YAML</i>:
</p>

<p>
Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed
outside the cluster without a Service. Services allow your
applications to receive traffic. Services can be exposed in different
ways by specifying a <code>type</code> in the ServiceSpec:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ClusterIP (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the
cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the
cluster.</li>

<li>NodePort - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected
Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from
outside the cluster using <code>&lt;NodeIP&gt;:&lt;NodePort&gt;</code>. Superset of
ClusterIP.</li>

<li>LoadBalancer - Creates an external load balancer in the current
cloud (if supported) and assigns a <b>fixed, external IP to the
Service.</b> Superset of NodePort.</li>

<li>ExternalName - Exposes the Service using an arbitrary name
(specified by externalName in the spec) by returning a CNAME record
with the name. No proxy is used. This type requires v1.7 or higher
of <code>kube-dns</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover note that services are the abstraction that allow pods to die and
replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application. Discovery
and routing among dependent Pods (such as the frontend and backend
components in an application) is handled by Kubernetes Services.
</p>

<p>
Services match a set of Pods using labels and selectors, a grouping
primitive that allows logical operation on objects in
Kubernetes. Labels are key/value pairs attached to objects and can be
used in any number of ways:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Designate objects for development, test, and production</li>
<li>Embed version tags</li>
<li>Classify an object using tags</li>
</ul>

<p>
To list the services running on your cluster you can run
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl get services
</pre></div>

<p>
To create a new service and expose it to the external traffic we'll
use the expose command with NodePort as parameter. We choose this
option as the tutorial runs through minikube and this does not support
the <i>Loadbalancer</i> option yet. Notice, however that in case this is
available it is recommended working through such an option.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type=&quot;NodePort&quot; --port 8080
</pre></div>

<p>
You can verify that your Service was properly exposed by controlling
with the <code>$ kubectl get services</code> option above.
</p>

<p>
Once the service is deployed with the internal assigned port as
specified above an external port is assigned to the service. You can
get this by inspecting the service specific characteristics
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## kubectl describe services/&lt;service name&gt;
$ kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp 
</pre></div>

<p>
And you can save it in your environment through 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template=&#39;{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}&#39;)
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then connect to the kubernetes app by any device by running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT
</pre></div>

<p>
Notice, moreover that the deployment created automatically a <i>label</i>
for our Pod. With the <code>$ describe deployment</code> command you can simply
get to it.
</p>

<p>
Given your label (<i>in the tutorial run=kubernetes-bootcamp</i>), you can then access your Pod directly thorough it.
</p>

<p>
For instance the command
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## kubectl get services -l &lt;label&gt;
$ kubectl get services -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp
</pre></div>

<p>
will get you the services running on pods with the given label.
</p>

<p>
You can add a label to a Pod by running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl label pod $POD_NAME app=v1
</pre></div>

<p>
This will be then added to the label of the pod and will allow you to
operate on the pod accordingly.
</p>

<p>
You can finally delete an existing service through:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>## kubectl delete service -l &lt;label&gt;
$ kubectl delete service -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp
</pre></div>

<p>
You will see then that after deleting the service your app deployed on the specific pod will not be externally accessible anymore, i.e.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT
</pre></div>

<p>
will fail. 
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless the app can always be reached internally given the Pod
name and the selected port deployment.
</p>

<h3 id="org3e1e37b">App scaling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3e1e37b">
<p>
In the previous modules we created a Deployment, and then exposed it
publicly via a Service. The Deployment created only one Pod for
running our application. When traffic increases, we will need to scale
the application to keep up with user demand.
</p>

<p>
<b>Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a
Deployment</b>
</p>

<p>
Scaling out a Deployment will ensure new Pods are created and
scheduled to Nodes with available resources. Scaling will increase the
number of Pods to the new desired state. Kubernetes also supports
autoscaling of Pods, but it is outside of the scope of this
tutorial. Scaling to zero is also possible, and it will terminate all
Pods of the specified Deployment.
</p>

<p>
Running multiple instances of an application will require a way to
distribute the traffic to all of them. Services have an integrated
load-balancer that will distribute network traffic to all Pods of an
exposed Deployment. Services will monitor continuously the running
Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is sent only to available
Pods.
</p>

<p>
To scale an deployment it is then possible to scale it specifying the
desired number of replicas by running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl scale deployments/&lt;deployment name&gt; --replicas=4
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then verify that the number of pods have been updated by
running the <code>$ kubectl get pods</code> command. 
</p>

<p>
Notice that different pods have different internal IP addresses. You
can read them through the <code>$ kubectl describe services
services/&lt;service name&gt;</code> command.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdbbd616" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdbbd616">New releases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdbbd616">
<p>
Users expect applications to be available all the time and developers
are expected to deploy new versions of them several times a day. In
Kubernetes this is done with rolling updates. Rolling updates allow
Deployments' update to take place <b>with zero downtime</b> by incrementally
updating Pods instances with new ones. The new Pods will be scheduled
on Nodes with available resources.
</p>

<p>
By default, the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during
the update and the maximum number of new Pods that can be created, is
one. Both options can be configured to either numbers or percentages
(of Pods). In Kubernetes, updates are versioned and any Deployment
update can be reverted to previous (stable) version.
</p>

<p>
Similar to application Scaling, if a Deployment is exposed publicly,
the Service will load-balance the traffic only to available Pods
during the update. An available Pod is an instance that is available
to the users of the application.
