So again front-end is not my stuff and will never be.
</p>

<p>
I need to develop a basic understanding of front-end in order to not
depend on other people as sometimes in the app I will have to
understand some front-end, back-end interactions without always being
shielded by some kind of REST-API.
</p>

<p>
So this work contains some research/on the job discoveries / debugging
stuff related to the the front-end.
</p>

<p>
Logically it will be very basic content that is not as interesting for
the expert in the field. It is much more my search and rescue
repository as I am often constructing.
</p>

<p>
This is important as I am noting that often things are recurrent.
</p>

<p>
In general if you ever will want to dig more into a more narrow
topic check at <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2019/#4.10">the following</a>.

<h2 id="org62a7ae3">On the javascript interaction with html and CSS stuff</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org62a7ae3">
<p>
So basically you are not alone in this universe. There are plenty
of people that are just looking for a basics understanding of it as
you are.
</p>

<p>
Check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38834375/relationship-between-html-and-javascript-the-basics-of-frontend-development">this url</a> containing exactly the same understanding that you
want to fix in your mind. (basically it follows the reply of the
most voted answer next)
</p>

<p>
So basically that is the idea:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>your browser request a front-end page from the back-end server.</li>

<li>the server sends an HTML page which usually includes:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DOM, CSS and Javascript as tags.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Note now that the DOM - is is a language-independent model made up
of objects representing the structure of a document. You can then
modify the structure of  the dome using that model. HMTL is just
one among the many languages that the model can operate on.
</p>

<p>
So understand that the HTML page contains all of the page, then by
using javascript you can actually manipulate the DOM and embedd
some dynamic logic such that you might display or not some
elements. So basically that is a little bit the idea.
</p>

<p>
More into the detail it works like this:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-01-24 133817.png" class="center">

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Browser starts by reading the HTML to create what is known as a content tree.</li>

<li>Then it "looks" at the CSS and "applies" the CSS to the content
tree and creates what is called a render tree. This has the
styling information added.</li>

<li>Finally it goes though layout process, where each of the HTML
elements are assigned exact physical window coordinates to
display at.</li>

<li>Finally everything is "painted" and you see the stylized HTML
page.</li>

<li>JavaScript is parsed by the browser seprately as it is
encountered in <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. JavaScript can add/delete/modify
existing components of the dom and change how CSS applies to
them. It can also make new network calls. (that is basically the
key point that you have to understand, as all of the other is
pretty straightforward and just a bit of static content that is
fetched via network - i.e. shipped by the server together with
the different html pages you ship)</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-orge77e8f5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge77e8f5">Understanding front-end applications</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge77e8f5">
<p>
Note now that this is the basics, so that now you can basically
understand basics issues with the front-end compoents.
</p>

<p>
I.e when you try to understand front-end applications and need to
debug them, first start by looking at the html 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
from there you should see the entire DOM. Everything that
could eventually appear should be visible in there.
</p>

<p>
(The only think that I can think of is if you get some other
html pages via javascript and ship and transform them in
such a way. No idea how much that is a use case in front-end
development. Can imagine that this might eventually be an
option if you do not want to display much to the browser
user&#x2026;)
</p></li>

<li><p>
then check for what you are looking for there. if you do not
find it, then you have to strart dig into the dynamic
components and check at the javascript scripts.
</p>

<p>
There will be either plain javascript in your html file or
you will have special scripts that you will fetch from the
server - such that you can search them in your workspace in
there.
</p>

<p>
Note that you might especially call some <code>show</code> or <code>hide</code>
methods to implement the logic etc. 
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Side note</i> for my project. Note that you do not have many html
files in your workspace. I.e. you might not see the specific html
that you are seeing your browser in your workspace. I think that
this is because of the mustache way of constructing them
dynamically.
</p>

<p>
Now that adds a little bit a layer of complexity as you need to
understand how you compile files into html files with mustache
etc. but that will come with time. Step by step - had already
started to dig into this sense when making notes on the one
project. Give it time but each time you write a post as this you
are one step closer to a general understanding of the situation.
