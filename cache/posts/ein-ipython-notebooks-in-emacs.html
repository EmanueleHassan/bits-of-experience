<p>
I recently decided to switch from using <code>ob-ipython</code> to <code>ein</code> for
working with the ipython kernel on Emacs. I was quite satisfied with
the first but I noticed it was not maintained anymore, while there
seems to be quite a lot of activity around <code>ein</code>. I therefore decided
to stay up to date in order to benefit from the development in the
second package.
</p>

<p>
This post summarizes the major things that makes it possible and the
key workflow to operate through <code>EIN</code> properly.

<p>
This is a nice thing. Better than ob-ipython.
</p>

<p>
Check at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB9vFu9Za8w">this video</a> to understand the power and it works well with
<code>org-mode</code> as possible to see in the chunck below.
</p>

<p>
To start the jupyter kernel you can use the following command
</p>

<p>
<code>ein:jupyter-start-server</code>
</p>

<p>
To stop the server you can then enter
</p>

<p>
<code>ein:jupyter-stop-server</code>
</p>

<p>
You can even try to login to a remote server.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> a = 14500
 print(a)
</pre></div>

<p>
n: 14500
</p>

<p>
Interesting if you go in your <code>Ibuffer</code> there is an EIN ipynb runtime
that is bounded to your org mode commands. There you can enter freely
the commands you want an experiment over there.
</p>

<p>
The buffer is called =*ein: <a href="http://localhost:8888/.ein-python.ipynb">http://localhost:8888/.ein-python.ipynb</a>* =
</p>

<p>
For instance defying the variable b over there you can then call it
over here in this org script.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> b = 7
 print (b)
</pre></div>

<b>How to run a ipython server and make it publicly accessible</b>

<p>
Notice that without specifying anything ein will open a default
notebook without virtualenvironment. To specify the virtualenvironment
you have to follow the next steps.
</p>

<p>
Once you did this; you can simply select the desired kernel from your
notebooklist.
</p>

<p>
Finally, after launching a new notebook connected to such kernel you
can bind your ein-python chuncks specifying the correct session
argument as below.
</p>

<p>
Once you define the session correctly and an ipynb is started
correctly the next time you do not have to iterate the procedure
above. It is sufficient to run <code>C-c</code> in the babal chunck and ein will
automatically start the correct notebook.
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  import sys
  import os
  import json
  import pandas as pd

  def read_json(file_path):
      with open(file_path) as f:
	  return json.load(f)

  sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(&#39;/Users/marcohassan/Desktop/IBM_projects/SchutzRettung/module-analytics/app/src/algorithms/utils/&#39;))
  from tokens import extract_tokens

  from nltk.metrics.scores import precision

  from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

  def get_tokens(text):

      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      Gets the tokenized question
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      return extract_tokens(text, stopwords=True, lemmatization = True,
					 stemming=False, ngrams=0)
</pre></div>


<p>
Good now you are ready to go and switch from <code>ob-ipython</code> to <code>ein</code>.
You have moreover many interesting commands on EIN when editing
directly the jupyter notebooks; for instance you can there split the
chuncks with <code>C-c C-s</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice however that for this the kitchin's group has also code that
you might copy.

<h2 id="org35b7289">Add kernel to jupyter</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35b7289">
<p>
To check which kernel are installed on your jupyter notebook server
you can run
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter<span class="w"> </span>kernelspec<span class="w"> </span>list
</pre></div>

<p>
It is then possible to add a virtualenvironment in the following way
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># activate virtualenvironment</span>
<span class="nb">source</span><span class="w"> </span>~/Desktop/python_venv/spark/bin/activate

<span class="c1"># download jupyter</span>
pip3<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>jupyter

<span class="c1"># Add the virtualenvironment kernel</span>
&lt;virtual_env&gt;/bin/ipython<span class="w"> </span>kernel<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--name<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;spark&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>--user
</pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter<span class="w"> </span>kernelspec<span class="w"> </span>list
</pre></div>

<p>
To remove a specific kernel you can then use
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter<span class="w"> </span>kernelspec<span class="w"> </span>uninstall<span class="w"> </span>&lt;unwanted_kernel&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
Notice that the kernelspec list must be of the type above with
<code>/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3</code> as path. Otherwise
something breaks and the virtualenvironment is not active for the
kernel.

<h2 id="org2a9e614">Switch your Ipython Kernel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2a9e614">
<p>
Now that you have multiple iypthon kernels you have to be careful and
check that your ipython notebook is connected to the right kernel for
the job you want to perform.
</p>

<p>
For that one you can either first create an <code>ipynb</code> from the notebook
server selecting the correct kernel you need to use. You can then
specify such notebook as the session argument as above.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise you can directly execute a cell in org. And later on the
opened notebook use the emacs function <code>ein:notebook-switch-kernel</code>.
