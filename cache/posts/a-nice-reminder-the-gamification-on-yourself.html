This is just another quick note for myself. I also set it in my
org-agenda as a reminder. I believe in this piece of advice.
</p>

<p>
This morning I was doing some research exploring the data science
consulting vs. in house data science world and what people usually
say in merit.
</p>

<p>
One reddit leads to the other and at the end I quickly was off
track. I ended up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mc77r3/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_pursue_your_own/">this thread</a>.

The entry that is important is the following:

Can I just say as a neuroscientist this is not your fault. Basically
we think we have control over what we do but this is an illusion. For
example you want to work on your project but you never do. So then you
feel shame/guilt etc which only makes you more unproductive.
</p>

<p>
The solution to this is that the mind behaves more like a computer
than we think. If you know how to properly interact with it you can
make it do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
Now there is a long list of behavioural psychology focused on
productivity but I will start you of with one thing. Right now create
a list it can be on your computer a website like trello.com or on
paper it doesn't matter. On it write 6 Things that you can accomplish
very quickly in relation to your project.
</p>

<p>
for example the list could be this:
</p>

<p>
make a project directory for my project.
download the dataset needed
install required tools for project
write first variable
write first function
Make the first graph
</p>

<p>
Set the commitment to do just one of these things per day, you don't have to do
anymore. Try adding new goals to your list as you complete old
ones. the goals should be easy to achieve 1 minute - 30 minutes for
each. Pretty soon you will be doing more than just one task.
</p>

<p>
This method efficiently uses your brains reward system. Doing small
clearly defined tasks with low commitment is easy and generally fun to
do. Doing a large complicated project with no clear approach is not
fun to do. There are tonnes of efficiency hacks and every person is
different. Good luck.

I mean nothing new. You invented the wheel you might
say. True.

Nonetheless it is commitment that makes the difference.  I have it
now as a reminder in my org-agenda. I am writing now a post here. I
will remember it and I will try it out for my current project.
</p>

<p>
The issue is that on trello/jira ,or whatever you generally use for
task management, you set too big tasks. On the top of it when I hold
my todos workflow with org-mode I usually write very specific todos
tasks related to work I have to accomplish. These are more things I
can or must do but involve little planning and the project
management experience described above. I.e. these are a general
reminder of what is in the pipeline rather than a micro-level
pipeline construction itself with the associated progress-reward
system.
</p>

<p>
So this is your take away. Start to build a capture template for
that. Every time you work on a project or start one, do that as a
first step. After all is the power of <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins">small wins</a>. This
makes the difference on the long run and it is always
underestimated.
