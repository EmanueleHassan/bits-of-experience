<p>
So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
</p>

<p>
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
</p>

<p>
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
</p>

<p>
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
</p>

<p>
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution">following entry</a>.
</p>

<p>
So what these models do is to decompose the risk of fixed-income
instruments in different components. You would then price the
different components and ultimately aggregate the risk of them.

<p>
So I will start in this post with the interest rate risk. I will
then check at other risk-factors as I go along. 
</p>

<p>
So the yield-curve and interest rate risk is just one among the many
factors. However, this is an important one.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you use your standard duration models you can perform
analysis of the risks for the case of parallel movements of the
yield-curve.
</p>

<p>
What happens though in the case of other more non-linear
movements? There you have to think in terms of different models
that can capture such shifts.
</p>

<p>
This is the reason why you can use factor-based models for the
interest reate curve that capture such non-linearities.
</p>

<p>
A typical decomposition in this sense is the:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>shift</li>

<li>twist</li>

<li>butterfly</li>
</ul>

<p>
decomposition.
</p>

<img src="../../images/yield-curve_glossary.jpg" class="center">

<p>
So note that the butterfly acts more on the curvature of the yield
curve hitting in multiple points.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the twist is more acting on the first-order level
changing the steepness of the yield curve but holding the general
curvature structure. Note that by definition changing the twist
will affect the curvature, and having a butterfly will affect the
steepness of the curve. The two are therefore not completely
isolated. Would be fun at some point to read more into the
mathematical relation of the two but as having enough things on
your plate this is jumped at the moment - and likely forever. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have a factor model for the yield-curve taking into
account the three elements and mapping the influence of each on the
yield curve you can start to make all of your scenario based on
it.
</p>

<p>
The simple idea as in the Nelson-Siegel model is the following:
</p>

<p>
-&gt; you have your observable yield curve and the given interest
rates at different maturities composing the curve.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; you have a function composed of constants terms (measuring
shifts), first order terms (measuring twist) and more complex terms
(measuring butterfly).
</p>

<p>
You then parameterize the influence of each term in order to get
the best possible representation of the current yield curve
(standard OLS / minimization exercise).
</p>

<p>
Once you found your parameteric representation of the yield curve
depending on that factors you can make your standard sensitivities
analysis by standard math-analysis arguments.
</p>

<p>
You have then a model to check the influence of various shifts of
the risk curve as you have a model to compute the influence on
different interest rates, which you can then use to price your
isntruments.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important side note:</b> Note that in the models you have two kind of
parameters. Paramters defining the influence of each shape term on
the yield curve and decay factor parameters defining the location
of the "humps" of the butterfly terms.
</p>

<p>
So this is a little bit the logic you reason with in the market
risk model for capturing the interest rate risk.
