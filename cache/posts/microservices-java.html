<h2 id="org7fbeff8">Definition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7fbeff8">
<blockquote>
<p>
a microservice consists of a single deployment executing within a
single process, isolated from other deployments and processes, that
supports the fulfillment of a specific piece of business
functionality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
First, a microservice implements a specific piece of business
functionality. This is known as a a bounded context , which is a
logical separation of multiple business problem domains within an
enterprise. By <i>logically breaking down a business domain into
multiple bounded contexts</i>, each bounded context <i>more accurately
represents its specific view</i> of the business domain and becomes
easier to model.
</p>

<p>
Multiple bounded contexts within in a single monolith can result in
"spaghetti code" as a result of <i>unnecessary inter-dependencies and
unplanned intermixing of contexts</i>. In a microservices architecture,
each of these capabilities is modeled individually as a bounded
context and implemented as a microservice that addresses each
specific bounded context.
</p>

<p>
Note that the industry believes now in the following concept <i>a
single application</i> for microservices.
</p>

<p>
This began nearly a decade ago by deploying a single microservice
per application server, and shortly thereafter evolved into
specialized microservice runtimes like Dropwizard, <i>Spring Boot</i>,
and more recently <i>Quarkus</i> to improve the developer and
administrator experience.

<p>
When it’s the first time a team is developing microservice
architectures, it’s even more critical to not create a <b>big picture</b>
up front.
</p>

<p>
Taking the time to create that big picture without previous
experience of microservices architecture design will expend time
when it’s likely the final architecture will actually be very
different.
</p>

<p>
During the process of gaining experience with microservices, the
architecture will shift over time towards a more appropriate
one.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>

<h2 id="org09ccd9c">On the transition period that is occuring</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org09ccd9c">
<p>
Java EE has been the standard-bearer for enterprise Java
specifications for roughly 20 years.
</p>

<p>
However, Java EE has been traditionally focused on 3-tier monolithic
architecture with a steady, measured evolution and a strong focus on
backward compatibility. Java EE stopped evolving between 2014 and
2017 just as the industry began to heavily adopt microservices
</p>

<p>
During that pause, the Java EE community <b>began to experiment and
deliver early microservices APIs</b>. There was an increasing risk of
API fragmentation across Java runtimes that had been known for
application portability.

<h2 id="orgaa8661f">Microprofile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa8661f">
<p>
MicroProfile extends that foundation through the creation and
evolution of Java API specifications for well-understood
microservices patterns and cloud-related standards.
</p>

<p>
Today, twelve sepcificications have been developed by the
MicroProfile community:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2021-12-21 142211.png" class="center">

<p>
So note for instance the open API specification. This is must be
similar to the RESTful swagger package you used to work with in
python. With it will be possible for you to easily specify the API
and document your RESTful endpoints. Note that you actually have
packages as that one <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/open-source/open-source-integrations/">for java as well</a>.
</p>

<p>
Back to Microprofile, the idea is essentially this, create a narrow
set of Java APIs for working in a more agile, microservices way.
</p>

<p>
As per Dec 2016 it was incorporated into the Eclipse Foundation.
This practically means that now the project is under the mantra:
open source, vendor neutrality, and community engagement and
collaboration.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it the Microprofile Working Group charter extends
those with additional standards. Pretty general and non-interesting
stuff but for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>no backward compatibility guarantee</b> I mean: awkshj?!?!?!?!??</li>
</ul>

<p>
That is interesting and if you will ever work with it you will have
well to bear it in mind. They justify it as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
MicroProfile considers itself an agile project and is willing to
break backward compatibility. This willingness results from a
rapid-moving specification project, and any breaking changes are well
thought out with strong justification and as narrow a scope as
possible.
</p>

<p>
bah&#x2026; not too convincing&#x2026; will cause troubles..

<div id="outline-container-org552b9bb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org552b9bb">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org552b9bb">
<p>
This is a Java microservices runtime.
</p>

<p>
Note that although you might think that there is no need for a new
microservice runtime, consider the following:
</p>

<p>
Another pain point is that <i>developer productivity</i> often suffers with
Java microservice runtimes.  Every time a developer makes a change
they have to save the file, <i>rebuild</i> the application, <i>restart</i> the
application, and <i>refresh</i> the browser. This can take 10s of seconds,
significantly impacting the productivity of a developer.
</p>

<p>
Developers and DevOps teams began to feel the pain of developing and
deploying Java microservices, and have been increasingly considering
alternatives like Node.js and Golang due to their reduced RAM
requirements and fast startup time. These alternatives can also
achieve a 5x to 10x deployment density on the same hardware,
significantly reducing cost.
</p>

<p>
So you understand that for these reasons it is convenient to have a
very well functioning microservices runtime.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that there is an interesting point for the case of
<b>dynamic language runtimes</b> - a thing that Quarkus is working in order
to deliver. I come from dynamic language runtimes languages and I
must say this is in fact a feature I like that allowed me to develop
at twice the speed and introducing less bugs as I had the
opportunity to double check on the fly and make some tests about the
current status of the application instead of having to compile,
start the application and enter in debug modus. 
</p>

<p>
Developers are rightfully enamored with the productivity of dynamic
language runtimes like Node.js, and Quarkus is driving to deliver
that experience even though Java is a "static" (pre-compiled)
language
</p>

<p>
Note now the functioning with Quarkus:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The top developer joy feature is live coding, where code changes are
detected, recompiled, and reloaded without having to restart the
JVM. Live coding is enabled when Quarkus is started in developer mode
using mvn quarkus:dev. Specifically, Quarkus checks for code changes
when it receives external events like HTTP requests or Kafka
messages. The developer simply makes code changes, saves the file, and
refreshes the browser for near-instant updates. Live coding even works
with pom.xml changes. The Quarkus maven plugin will detect pom.xml
changes and restart the JVM. It is not uncommon for Quarkus developers
to start Quarkus in developer mode, and then minimize the terminal
window, never having to restart the JVM during a coding session.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is neat and not just an ancillary benefit.
</p>

<p>
Check at the following statistics:

<div id="outline-container-orgf6c7e54" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf6c7e54">On Working in tandem Quarkus + MicroProfile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6c7e54">
<p>
Basically if you want to go down the microservices road in a serious
way you will have to start to think in these terms:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quarkus as first class citizen for microservices running on
Kubernetes</li>

<li>MicroProfile - use this specifications to facilitate microservices
development.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you understand that ideally you would use the two in tandem.
</p>

<p>
Now on the concrete side of the coin, you know that to have a proper
kubernetes development experience in your team is almost
impossible. It is too small and to this stage I do not really see it
as a viable road. I will reconsider later in time when I will see
how much the reality barrier will drag me down and how much it is
really possible to develop in the given time with the given
resources.
</p>

<p>
So maybe start to dig a little bit more down the road of
MicroProfile at first and leave Quarkus then for a later moment when
you will have the first things more under control.
</p>

<p>
I am especially interested to understand how the MicroProfile component
interfaces with the Spring framework. As far as I understood this is
the go-to framework in the industry to develop microservices in
Java. However, this changes a bit the perspectives.

spring boot vs. quarkus - so the basic difference at high level is
that spring boot is more mature as a project, it is better
integrated with the entire Java Ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand Quarkus aims to develop in that dimension while
being more suited as architecture for the container world. The
start up time is much faster and you can construct with it more
robust reactive architectures.
</p>

<p>
You can read more for the difference among the two - at high

<p>
Take time at some point to go over it.

<p>
But basically you have Spring and Quarkus Native that are in fact
the real way of doing containerized workloads and reactive
architectures in the cloud.

<p>
As ngnix was still underlying the entire concept of docker. So will
tomcat, Jboss or whatever still underpin the concept here.
</p>

<p>
Have to understand better how that concept works. Also with respect
to quarkus and spring boot.
</p>

<p>
I know that tomcat underpins spring boot. Does it also underpins
quarkus? How is the fast start-up etc. ensured?

<p>
I.e. you have under this project all of the necessary dependencies
with Spring etc.

<h2 id="org786d96f">On a side Note - on cloud-native java vs. Golang</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org786d96f">
<p>
One of the things that I was continuously reading was the emergence
of Golang. 
</p>

<p>
Now that I understand better the Java ecosystem and that I am
experiencing its transition and I understand better key benefits and
drawbacks I understand why such language is emerging. 
</p>

<p>
It is not simply a thing of the language itself. People are saying
that is very easy to pick up etc. and is a very powerful language
etc.
</p>

<p>
Now that I am starting to understand better the IT landscape I am
starting to understand that this is the sauce around the meat, not
the meat itself. 
</p>

<p>
Ecosystems develop. That is the important thing. And the ecosystem
game is the one that signals if a language will win over the other
or not. 
</p>

<p>
And that is what is happening right now. The java ecosystem is
moving as you can read above. And I guess it will not go away
overnight as I see it in my working experience. It is much easier to
modernize staying in the same language as completely switching. 
</p>

<p>
That will be the most painful thing bounding an extreme amount of
resource. No way to go.
</p>

<p>
That said here <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/cloud-native-java-vs-golang-2a72c0531b05#:~:text=Both%2520the%2520golang%2520and%2520cloud,and%2520very%2520rarely%2520within%25207s.">an article</a> that goes a bit in that direction. You can
