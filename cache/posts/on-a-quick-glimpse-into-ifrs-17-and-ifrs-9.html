<p>
So I am quickly checking into these for an interview. 
</p>

<p>
It will be in no way thorough or complete. 
</p>

<p>
It is just for me to get a rough idea about the topic such that you
will not fall out of a tree if the things are mentioned.

<h2 id="orgff9c3c3">IFRS 17</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff9c3c3">
<p>
These notes are based on the following: <a href="https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/insurance-contracts/ifrs-standard/ifrs-17-project-summary.pdf">link1</a>.
</p>

<p>
Generally it holds:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
IFRS 17 sets out the requirements that a company1 should apply in
reporting information about insurance contracts it issues and
reinsurance contracts it holds.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The issues under the current set up are mainly the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(a) identify which groups of insurance contracts are profit making or
loss making; and 
</p>

<p>
(b) analyse trend information about insurance contracts
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
IFRS 17 provides in this sense:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(a) provides <b>updated information</b> about the obligations, risks and
performance of insurance contracts; 
</p>

<p>
(b) increases <b>transparency</b> in financial information reported by
insurance companies, which will give investors and analysts more
confidence in understanding the insurance industry; and 
</p>

<p>
(c) introduces <b>consistent accounting</b> for all insurance contracts
based on a current measurement model. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
IFRS 17 particularly aims to tackle long-term contracts with
difficult to measure risk, for which there are no traded proxies on
the market.
</p>

<p>
Contracts that include a significant <b>deposit component</b> — an amount
the insurer is obligated to pay the policyholder regardless of
whether the insured event occurs.

<h3 id="org5dcb959">Key Components in IFRS 17 reporting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5dcb959">
<p>
There are two essential components that you have to understand
that are core to IFRS 17:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>fulfilment cash flows</li>
</ol>

<p>
the <b>current</b> estimates of amounts that the insurer expects to
collect from premiums and pay out for claims, benefits and
expenses, including an adjustment for the timing and risk of those
cash flows;
</p>

<p>
The measurement of the fulfilment cash flows reflects the current
value of any <i>interest-rate guarantees</i> and <i>financial options</i>
included in the insurance contracts.
</p>

<p>
Note that given the time value of money at each reporting date the
fulfilment cash flow will be re-estimated and will vary accordingly.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>contractual service margin</li>
</ol>

<p>
This represents the unearned profit that an entity expects to earn
as it provides services.
</p>

<p>
When applying IFRS 17, changes in the estimates of the expected
premiums and payments that relate to <b>future</b> insurance coverage
will adjust the expected profit—ie the contractual service margin
for a group of insurance contracts will be increased or decreased
by the effect of those changes. (<b>TODO</b>: understand that better)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such that it holds:

<h3 id="org46191e8">Channels for Earning Profits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org46191e8">
<p>
This reflect the general insurance business. There is the usual
split between profits from insurance service result (i.e. risk
pooling) and profit from asset management - i.e. financial result
that you get by investing the premiums in a smart way that matches
your expected outflows duration etc.
</p>

<p>
In general you have therefore the following categorization:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(a) the insurance service result, which depicts the profit earned
from providing insurance coverage; 
</p>

<p>
(b) the financial result, which captures: 
</p>

<p>
(i) investment income from managing financial assets; and 
</p>

<p>
(ii) insurance finance expenses from insurance obligations—the 
effects of discount rates and other financial variables on the
value of insurance obligations.
I.e. financial movements on the liability side.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With IFRS 17 it will be easier to account from which earning
profits stream the profits are generating. It will therefore be
easier to assess the way the insurance work under IFRS 17.
