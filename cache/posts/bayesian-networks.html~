Here are some Notes about the topic of my Master Thesis - Bayesian
Networks.
</p>

<p>
Note that most of these Notes are based on <i>Probabilistic Graphical
Models - Principles and Techniques</i> (<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193">Koller and Friedman</a>).

<p>
The general outlook.
</p>

<p>
So recall that in general you have three elements in Bayesian
Networks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Representation

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
how do you represent the joint probability of the events as a
network (i.e. as a graph data structure)? Can such structure
represent the joint in a compact way due to the conditional
independence relations?
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 1:</b> that such compact formulation is one of the key benefits of
Bayesian Networks as it really gives the possibility of shrinking
the amount of parameters needed to describe the full joint
probability leveraging the independence structure among the RVs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 2:</b> this formulation is <i>transparent</i>, i.e. highly
understandable also to non-AI experts. It is so to say highly
explainable and in this new buzz of <i>explainable AI</i> a solid
option.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Inference

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>given some information about some Parent variables, how can I
infer/compute the distribution of the children in the Network?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Learning

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>given some observed data, how can I use such information to
construct / (infer) / learn the  <i>structure</i> of the network?</li>

<li>given some observed data, how can I learn the <i>parameters</i> of the
network? I.e. how can I use the information content of the data to
derive some plausible parameterization of the network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
So these are the main tasks you have to deal with in Bayesian
Networks. Basically you can do all of the three in a very simple way,
which is from a theoretical standpoint very concrete and
straightforward or you can start to consider all the aspects of the
problem going quickly towards more complex situations.

   <br/>

   As mentioned bayesian networks allow us to express the joint
   through less parameters.

   <br/>
   <br/>

   The idea is that you factorize the joint as a product of the
   conditionals and given the parameterization of the conditionals you
   fully specify the joint. Given the independence structures the
   number of factorization of conditional terms is limited and the
   overall necessary parameters to specify the joint small.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   
   For instance if a Variable D is fully determined by its parents B,
   C in this graph:

   <br/>   
   <br/>
   
   Then you might well understand that given B, C you do not need
   P(D | A, B, C) parameters as P(D | B, C) suffices.
  </p>
  <br style="clear: both;" />
</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>   

<p>
A concrete example is the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-15_um_13.21.25.png">

<p>
Notice there that instead of needing 2 (Diff) * 2 (Int) * 3
(Grade) * 2 (Sat) * 2 (Let) = 48 parameters to describe the joint
you simply need 2 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 22.
</p>

<p>
Given this understanding it is immediate to see that Bayesian
Networks are defined as above, i.e. as a graph data structure to
which <i>local probabilities</i> are applied. In the specific each RV in
the graph is associated with <i>conditional probability distributions
(CPD)</i> that specify the distribution given each possible joint
assignment of values to its parents. And the graph structure
together with the CPD specifies the Bayesian Network.
</p>

<p>
A <b>second</b> representation/ definition of Bayesian Networks is to
define it via a <i>global probability P</i> together with the independence
relations determined by the graph.
</p>

<p>
To determine independence relations in graphs you can use standard
logic where the argument is essentially the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Our intuition tells us that the parents of a variable “shield” it
from probabilistic influence that is causal in nature. In other
words, once I know the value of the parents, no information
relating directly or indirectly to its parents or other ancestors
can influence my beliefs about it. However, information about its
descendants can change my beliefs about it, via an evidential
reasoning process. (Koller and Friedman)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such that you would have the following <i>local independence
structures</i>:
</p>

<p>
\[ For each variable X_i : (X_i \perp NonDescendants X_i | Parents
   X_i) \]
</p>

<p>
Notice that such set of independence is called an I-map for a
probability distribution <i>P</i>. You then say that a graph <i>G</i> is an
I-map for <i>P</i> if it satisfies the I-map relations specified <i>I(P)</i>.
</p>

<p>
And you would ultimately have the following definition:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-15_um_14.50.38.png">

<p>
So that you basically take here the opposite direction, from a
joint distribution <i>P</i> and the local independence structure you
have a fully specified Bayesian Network.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that you can go from one representation to the other and the
BN is defined <b>if and only if</b> you can from one to the other.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf6946bf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf6946bf">On Graph Dependencies and D-separation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf6946bf">
<p>
Given the above discussion and the fact that it is possible to
determine the BN given a joint density and a Graph structure, the
question now is on how to extract the conditional independence
structures implied by a graph, i.e. to extract the I-map
relations.
</p>

<p>
In order to do that a simple algorithm exists the <i>d-separation
algorithm</i>.
</p>

<p>
The idea here is the following. You know that for three nodes X,
Y, Z there exists a dependence structure between X and Y if one of
the following conditions <b>hold</b>:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-15_um_15.18.31.png">

<p>
This is quite intuitive.
</p>

<p>
It follows now that we can quickly assess whether two variables
are generally conditionally independent by making reasonings
leveraging the active trails as above.
</p>

<p>
I.e. for two variables to be <b>dependent</b> there must be an active
trail as defined by the conditions above.
</p>

<p>
Notice that for instance in the student BN you can investigate
the conditional independence between SAT and Difficulty as
follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-15_um_15.25.30.png">


<p>
Generally it holds:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-15_um_15.26.42.png">

<p>
You can then find in the book an algorithm for checking
d-separation, if interested at any point in time. Notice that
there is are also reasonings about <i>completeness</i> and <i>soundness</i>
of d-separation. I.e. how well that covers and fully specifies
independence structures of <i>P</i>.
</p>

<p>
I write in here the definition of <i>completeness</i> and <i>soundness</i>
should it be of interest at any point at a later stage:
</p>

<p>
<i>Soundness</i>:
</p>

<p>
If two nodes X and Y are d-separated given some Z, then we are
guaranteed that they are, conditionally independent given Z.
</p>

<p>
<i>Completeness</i>:
</p>

<p>
D-separation is complete if it detects all of the possible
independencies. I.e. if two variables X and Y are independent
given Z, then they are d-separated.
</p>

<p>
Formally:

<div id="outline-container-orgfa7d107" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfa7d107">On CPD</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfa7d107">
<p>
So far we discussed the possibility of representing the
high-dimensional joint distribution into a product of
lower-dimensional CPDs or factors, i.e. a product of local
probabilities models.
</p>

<p>
In this section we explore more into the detail the possibility of
representing such CPDs.
</p>
</div>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orgc1ff188"></a>Tabular CPD<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc1ff188">
<p>
This is the most basics form of CPD. It works for spaces composed
solely of <b>discrete</b> valued RV.
</p>

<p>
It consists in expressing the \(P(X | PA_X)\) as a table that
contains the joint probability of \(X \and PA_X\).
</p>

<p>
This is essentially what was given in the example above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> it is important to realize that the number of joint
probabilities that you have to express is given by
</p>

<p>
\[|Val(PA_X)| * |Val(X)|\]
</p>

<p>
I.e. it grows <i>exponentially</i> in the number of parents. This is a
serious problem in many settings. You can also not ask an expert
to express all such CPDs. He will loose patient at some point.
</p>

<p>
So the idea is to find a mechanism to express each and every
\(P(X | PA_X)\) for each X and \(PA_X\) but without doing the
exercise explicitly.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you should find a <i>functional formula CPD = f(X, PA<sub>X</sub>)</i> such
that you can leverage some structures represented by the
functional formula and do not have to express all of the
probabilities individually.
</p>

<p>
You can then read in the book some forms of such deterministic
CPDs. The general idea is quite simple. There might be
deterministic structures that naturally arise due to the
structure of the modeled phenomena.
</p>

<p>
Moreover for deterministic networks you might have the notion of
<code>context specific independence</code>. Here the idea is that given some
particular configuration \(X \cup Y \cup Z\) you might have
independence of X and Y given Z in this particular configuration.
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org1257413"></a>Context Specific CPDs for non-deterministic dependecies<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1257413">
<p>
Structure in CPDs might not just arise in the case of
context-specific CPDs.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that often there is some structure such that for
certain realizations a RV X given some partial assignment to some
subset of parents $ U &sub; PA<sub>X</sub>$ the probability is fully
specified and does not depend on the remaining parents.
</p>

<p>
Two ways to capture such structure is through Tree-CPDs and
rule-based CPDs.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orga332f9c"></a>Tree-CPDs<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orga332f9c">
<p>
This is a very intuitive structure for every human. In fact
trees are used continuously. There is a natural tendencies for
such structures in engineering so nothing new. You saw them 100s
time.
</p>

<p>
However, what is interesting is the example. In fact it is easy
to see that by leveraging the tree structure, i.e. the context
specific structure and the resulting independencies you can
highly reduce the total number of parameters.
</p>

<p>
To understand that think of the following example:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-19_um_12.01.18.png" class="center">

<p>
It is immediate then to see that the above highly reduces the
number of parameters.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-19_um_12.03.41.png" class="center">


<p>
Notice that when we talk we say that the Tree-CPDs represent the
network context specific information. This is immediate to see
as you do not in fact consider the full structure of the network, but
you already factor out some of the independencies.
</p>

<p>
To see that consider, the following case where you would have
two recommendation letters and are applying for a job. You have
to choose among the two. Then you can represent the case in the
following ways:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-20_um_19.08.25.png" class="center">

<p>
It is clear that on the left you work at the network structure
not leveraging context specific information while on (b) you
already start to pack that in.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org583fecf"></a>Rule-based<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org583fecf">
<p>
Another possibility to pack information of the network structure
by leveraging context specific information is via <code>rule-CPDs</code>.
</p>

<p>
They are defined in the following way:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-20_um_19.31.28.png" class="center">


<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-20_um_19.50.22.png" class="center">

<p>
It follows immediately that it basically consists in sets joint
co-occurrences of RV and assigns probabilities to such cases.
</p>

<p>
With it you can then basically express all sorts of CPDs
structures that are based on some partitioning.
</p>

<p>
It is in fact immediate to see that tree-CPDs can be easily
expressed via rule-based CPDs but the converse is not true.

<li><a id="orgdd6c7c5"></a>Independence of Causal Influence<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdd6c7c5">
<p>
Here the idea is the case where you have a set of variables X<sub>i</sub>
influencing Y, such that X<sub>i</sub> can influence Y in an arbitrary
way. I.e. you assume that X<sub>i</sub> can interact with each other in
complex ways making the <b>effect of each combination unrelated to
any other possible combination</b>.
</p>

<p>
Two such models that fulfill such characteristics are
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the noisy-or model</li>

<li>the generalized linear models.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org89de291"></a>Noisy Or Model<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org89de291">
<p>
This is a very simple model. If an event occurs then you have no
100% guarantee that the usual reaction will occur. That is there
is some noise in the model and some side reaction might happen.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance at working hard at work. Then with 90% you
might have a successful project. However, due to some random
factor, say sudden cut of budget or company restructuring, your
project might fail. This is the <i>noisy part</i> and the noisy or
model.
</p>

<p>
This is the general setting. It is then possible to express such
a noisy model through a graphical representation.
</p>

<p>
Think of the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/bayesNet2.png">

<p>
It follows then that W<sub>1</sub> expresses the probability of the noisy
factor taking place - i.e. budget restriction. Such that
&lambda;<sub>W</sub> = P(W<sub>1</sub> | W) = 0.9. Where W = work hard and W<sub>1</sub> = normal condition.
Notice now, the case where independently on your hard work the
team mate hard work also affects the result. Then you could be
in a situation as the following
</p>


<div  style ="height: 40%; width: 50%; margin:0 auto;">
   <img src="../../images/bayesNet3.png">
</div>

<p>
Again also the TW hard work induces a probability of success of
95%, i.e. &lambda;_<sub>TW</sub> = P(TW<sub>1</sub> | TW) = 95%, and there is a 5%
prob of failure due to restructuring and budget cut.
</p>

<p>
This is essentially the Noisy-or model. You have a deterministic
or relation influencing the project success - i.e. either your
work or your team members work. You have noise, i.e. despite the
factors you might have project failures due to some
unpredictable conditions - noise. Overall the probability of
success is given by products of lambdas. I.e. if both team work
and individual work multiply both lambdas. If just one, then
take the respective lambda etc.
</p>

<p>
More formally such model is defined as:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-02-21_um_09.48.03.png" class="center">

<p>
Notice that the <i>leak probability</i> was not discussed that
far. It consists of the probability of project success even in
the case that no hard work - for neither myself nor the team
members was put in the project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that in such a models the parameters would be represented
by the estimation of the <i>different lambdas</i>.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org7f23cd7"></a>Generalized Linear Models<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org7f23cd7">
<p>
These are networks where the interaction among the variables is
represented by generalized linear models you saw a couple of
times in your studies.
</p>

<p>
Recall that in generalized linear models you would have a linear
model
</p>

<p>
\[ f(X_1, ..., X_p) = \sum_{i}^{p} w_i * X_i  \]
</p>

<p>
That would represent the load that the parents sets on the
system. Where the load of each individual variable might be
higher or lower and is therefore weighted.
</p>

<p>
Then basically you would transform such a load into a
probability by applying a sensible transformation that could
well reflect the system work. I.e. a very wide used example is
the S-shaped structure that can be modeled via logit or probit
models.
</p>

<p>
You can also start to make inference on what happens
if&#x2026; cases. For instance in the book it is discussed on how, in
the case of a binary model, the log-odd probability changes
w.r.t. a change in one of the independent binary RV. This gives
you an idea of some possible structures and relations that could
occur in such models so that if representative of some real
world situation you can leverage on this.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that here once the transformation is defined the only
parameters left are the weights/loads entering the linear part
of the model. You should therefore specify these under this
setting.

</ul>

<li><a id="orgad8ab39"></a>Continuous Variables<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgad8ab39">
<p>
These are not discussed here. Have to move on. The idea is always
the same. You now have some continuous variables, say Y and
X. You would then have for instance a relation governed by a
normal distribution where \(Y \sim N( \beta * X, \sigma^2)\).
</p>

<p>
That would actually be the case when
</p>

<p>
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{P} \beta_i X_i + \epsilon \]
</p>

<p>
where &epsilon; is gaussian N(0, &sigma;<sup>2</sup>). So again the usual
stuff.

<h3 id="org7b60909">Inference</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b60909">
<p>
An important exercise for inference is to query
distributions. I.e. as said the task is to compute the probability
of the occurrence of some RV given some evidence <i>E</i>, i.e. a subset
of RVs that is observed.
</p>

<p>
So in general the task is to determine:
</p>

<p>
\[ P (Y | E = e) \]
</p>

<p>
where <code>Y = query variable</code> and <code>E = evidence</code>.
</p>

<p>
Given such definition of probability queries it is possible to
introduce the <b>first type</b> of query: <i>MAP queries</i>.
</p>

<p>
\[ MAP (W| e) = \operatorname*{argmax}_w P (w,e)\]
</p>

<p>
where W = all non-observed RV.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I.e. in MAP queries you are interested in finding the most likely
joint assignment of the non-observed variables given the evidence.
</p>

<p>
If you perform MAP queries for a single RV Y then you are basically
computing a probability query for all of the possible realizations
y and selecting the most probable one.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the joint prob. maximizing the likelihood might well
differ from the individual RV maximizing realization.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
A <b>second type of query</b> is: <i>Marginal MAP Query</i>:
</p>

<p>
The idea of this is well explained in the book via example.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a class of disease. You want to find the most
likely disease given your evidence. Assume that you observe a
subset of symptoms E = e. You want to find the MAP assignment of
the disease Y.
</p>

<p>
The issue is now that you have non-observed symptoms: Z.
</p>

<p>
If you now have a disease that has just a small number of
associated symptoms with high probability, and you observe such
symptoms, then your MAP query will likely select this realization
as most likely.
</p>

<p>
In reality there might well be a more likely realization - i.e. a
different RV that is associated with a lot of symptoms with small
probability. The result is that when taking that into account and
therefore considering the possible influence of non-observed
symptoms the conclusion might be well different.
</p>

<p>
For this it makes sense to consider <i>marginal MAP</i> that tries in
fact to adjust for the presence of the other <b>non-observed RVs
influencing the outcome</b>.
</p>

<p>
\[ marginal MAP (Y | e) = \operatorname*{argmax}_Y  \sum_{Z}{P (Y,
   Z | e)} \]
</p>
