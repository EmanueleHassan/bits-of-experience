Here are some Notes about the topic of my Master Thesis - Bayesian
Networks.
</p>

<p>
Note that most of these Notes are based on <i>Probabilistic Graphical
Models - Principles and Techniques</i> (<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193">Koller and Friedman</a>).

The general outlook.
</p>

<p>
So recall that in general you have three elements in Bayesian
Networks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Representation

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
how do you represent the joint probability of the events as a
network (i.e. as a graph data structure)? Can such structure
represent the joint in a compact way due to the conditional
independence relations?
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 1:</b> that such compact formulation is one of the key benefits of
Bayesian Networks as it really gives the possibility of shrinking
the amount of parameters needed to describe the full joint
probability leveraging the independence structure among the RVs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note 2:</b> this formulation is <i>transparent</i>, i.e. highly
understandable also to non-AI experts. It is so to say highly
explainable and in this new buzz of <i>explainable AI</i> a solid
option.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Inference

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>given some information about some Parent variables, how can I
infer/compute the distribution of the children in the Network?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Learning

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>given some observed data, how can I use such information to
construct / (infer) / learn the  <i>structure</i> of the network?</li>

<li>given some observed data, how can I learn the <i>parameters</i> of the
network? I.e. how can I use the information content of the data to
derive some plausible parameterization of the network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
So these are the main tasks you have to deal with in Bayesian
Networks. Basically you can do all of the three in a very simple way,
which is from a theoretical standpoint very concrete and
straightforward or you can start to consider all the aspects of the
problem going quickly towards more complex situations.

<p>
As mentioned bayesian networks allow us to express the joint
through less parameters.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that you factorize the joint as a product of the
conditionals and given the parameterization of the conditionals you
fully specify the joint. Given the independence structures the
number of factorization of conditional terms is limited and the
overall necessary parameters to specify the joint small.
</p>

<p>
For instance if a Variable D is fully determined by its parents B,
C in this graph

<h3 id="orgdc91f46">Inference</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdc91f46">
<p>
An important exercise for inference is to query
distributions. I.e. as said the task is to compute the probability
of the occurrence of some RV given some evidence <i>E</i>, i.e. a subset
of RVs that is observed.
</p>

<p>
So in general the task is to determine:
</p>

<p>
\[ P (Y | E = e) \]
</p>

<p>
where <code>Y = query variable</code> and <code>E = evidence</code>.
</p>

<p>
Given such definition of probability queries it is possible to
introduce the <b>first type</b> of query: <i>MAP queries</i>.
</p>

<p>
\[ MAP (W| e) = \operatorname*{argmax}_w P (w,e)\]
</p>

<p>
where W = all non-observed RV.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I.e. in MAP queries you are interested in finding the most likely
joint assignment of the non-observed variables given the evidence.
</p>

<p>
If you perform MAP queries for a single RV Y then you are basically
computing a probability query for all of the possible realizations
y and selecting the most probable one.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the joint prob. maximizing the likelihood might well
differ from the individual RV maximizing realization.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
A <b>second type of query</b> is: <i>Marginal MAP Query</i>:
</p>

<p>
The idea of this is well explained in the book via example.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a class of disease. You want to find the most
likely disease given your evidence. Assume that you observe a
subset of symptoms E = e. You want to find the MAP assignment of
the disease Y.
</p>

<p>
The issue is now that you have non-observed symptoms: Z.
</p>

<p>
If you now have a disease that has just a small number of
associated symptoms with high probability, and you observe such
symptoms, then your MAP query will likely select this realization
as most likely.
</p>

<p>
In reality there might well be a more likely realization - i.e. a
different RV that is associated with a lot of symptoms with small
probability. The result is that when taking that into account and
therefore considering the possible influence of non-observed
symptoms the conclusion might be well different.
</p>

<p>
For this it makes sense to consider <i>marginal MAP</i> that tries in
fact to adjust for the presence of the other <b>non-observed RVs
influencing the outcome</b>.
</p>

<p>
\[ marginal MAP (Y | e) = \operatorname*{argmax}_Y  \sum_{Z}{P (Y,
   Z | e)} \]
