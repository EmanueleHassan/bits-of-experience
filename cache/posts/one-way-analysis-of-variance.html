This post discusses the comparison of different effects among
different groups. It will start with a refresh of the <i>t-test</i> 
used for <i>pair-wise</i> comparison among different groups and it extends
the concept for situations with \(groups \geq 2\) in order to check
whether results are statistically significant among them.

<p>
As a brief reminder it is possible to compare the means of two
independent groups using a <i>two sample t-test</i>. 
</p>

<p>
The basic idea of the test is that assuming i.i.d. observation from
two different groups \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) it is possible to compute summary
statistics for the two.
</p>

<p>
It is then possible to prove, that the computed mean from the
i.i.d. observation converges in probability to the normal distribution
due to the <i>Law of the Large Numbers</i> and the <i>Central Limit
Theorem</i>. 
</p>

<p>
\[ \bar{X} \overset{p}{\to} N (\mu, \sigma^2) \]
</p>

<p>
Given the further fact that the linear combination of normal
distributed variables is normal distributed it follows that the
difference among the mean value of the groups of choice \(X_1\) and
\(X_2\) is as well normal distributed with
</p>

<p>
\[ \bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 \overset{p}{\to} N (\mu_1 - \mu_2, \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) \]
</p>

<p>
where the variance does not display the covariance between the two
group observation as these were assumed to be independent.
</p>

<p>
This is essentially the basic theory on which the t-test relies. The
difference in the mean of two groups of choice is then simply
counterpoised to the Null \(H_0\) and the normal distribution is
replaced by the t-distribution due to the final sample of the
observations.

<h2 id="sec-2">The \(n \geq 2\) case</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In case of existing groups \(n \geq 2\) it is not possible to directly
apply the t-test outlined above. It is therefore necessary to expand
the theory developed so far.
</p>

<p>
Consider therefore <i>m</i> different groups containing each <i>n</i>
observations. Assuming moreover that for each of the <i>m</i> different
groups we observed a \(N(\mu_i, \sigma)\) response variable it is clear
that we observe <i>m + 1</i> parameters, because of the <i>m</i> different means
and the common variance shared among the groups.
</p>

<p>
Notice now that albeit the different groups will display different
means it is possible to rewrite their response variable disentangling
the different effects affecting the response variables; namely in:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a common component &mu; shared among all the response variables in
the groups different groups
</li>

<li>a group specific &alpha;<sub>i</sub> component adjusting the effect of the
common component &mu; to reflect the information of the group
specific mean &mu;<sub>i</sub>
</li>

<li>a stochastic component &epsilon;<sub>ij</sub> ~ N (0, &sigma;<sup>2</sup>). 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It follows that 
</p>

<p>
Notice however how an additional parameter was introduced. <i>m + 2</i>
parameters result from the above equation. <i>We silently introduced an
additional parameter</i> with the result that the problem is not
<i>identifiable</i> anymore given that we currently have <i>m+1</i> parameters
to mode <i>m</i> means. 
</p>

<p>
In order to address the issue it is therefore necessary to add a side
constant in order to add a further equality that will restore the
<i>well specification</i> of the problem. 
</p>

<p>
It is common to apply one of three major <i>side-constrains</i>:

Notice therefore that after adding the side-constant only <i>g-1</i>
elements of the groups are allowed to vary freely and therefore we
have <i>g-1</i> degrees of freedom.

Given the decomposition above it is possible to set up the general
framework for comparing the different effect of different treatments
groups.
</p>

<p>
First of all we notice that we estimate the <i>g-1</i> parameters of
interest by the <b>least square method</b>.
</p>

<p>
It follows therefore 
</p>

<p>
\[ \hat{\mu} \textasciicircum{\alpha_i} = argmin_{\mu, \alpha_i} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \sum^{n}_{j=1} (y_{ij} - \mu - \alpha_i)^2   \]
