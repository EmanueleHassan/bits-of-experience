This is a personal post where I keep some personal activities/places I
am aim to visit at some point.

<p>
I am further structuring this post. I am adding a movie

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtisel">Shtisel</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
I was home over Easter. I watched with the family the third
season. Very nice series. Much better than <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorthodox_(Miniserie)">unorthodox</a>. There
everything was a little bit too much exasperated.
</p>

<p>
This is nice. I would say it's kosher. It well summarizes the
Jewish mentality with all its pro and cons.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKtvrvZC8OY">Il mondo che vorrei</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
This was an interview with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Francesco">Pope Francesco I</a>. It was a good
watch. In a rough world that is hard to navigate is always good to
listen to such people reminding the true christian values on which
the western society build on. These are not values augmenting the
individualism but rather stressing the importance of the community
that we must protect and remind us.
</p>

<p>
The message was centered about fostering a culture of <i>us</i> in
contrast to an <i>egocentric</i> view, in promoting a culture where we
have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhVsgxlYsEA">empathy</a> and care for the others. In refusing a culture of
waste, where if we do not like something, if something creates a
problem or if something/someone does not fit, well we throw it
away, be it a human being or a thing, instead of trying to solve
the problem with it.
</p>

<p>
Good fellow as always Pope Francesco, may he stay healthy.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Island_(film)">L'isola delle rose</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow! What an incredible story. I love it. It is a daydreamer story
like me. Makes well the point of the italian genius. It lives in a
different dimension. We idealist animals&#x2026;
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En1jkf34xjc">La vita davanti a sé</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Very good movie. Strong like Momo. It is a very mixed movie. It
encompasses many feelings and it is much food for thoughts. There
is not a bottom line to it and it is not a light watch where there
not need to be a bottom line. 
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to write a snippet summarizing it. I liked it. One
of the things I liked was the power of Momo. I guess that a key in
the movie is how the energy of such people when channeled in the
right will make them shine. The weird element of the lion in the
movie goes in this direction. There is a lion / fire in some
people and it can turn to very good or bad outcomes depending on
who is there in the path of such people - be it Madame Rosa or the
other guy.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is also to notice that not the spoiled child, but
rather the suffered one will have the fire. Help such people and
let them shine.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMuQfYdgWxw">Sorelle Macaluso</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow wow wow!!! There are film directors that do movies. They stay in
the daily life of each of us and touch daily topics. Mundane - I
think this is the word.
</p>

<p>
This transcends everything. What a beautiful mind the one of the
movie director. To get the gravity of the life and what each one
of us needs to face in our life and bring it on the big screen in
such a way is simply&#x2026; wow. And the lyrics that goes along the
movie. It's liberty music. Despite the hard life we are able to
face it and go on with such a power. Crazy movie. Possibly one of
the best, if not the best I ever saw.
</p>

<p>
And I usually do not touch or go along the female vs male story. I
do not like dichotomies. But damn it you feel the touch of a
female soul in the movie. And if this is what we missed, give way
to the woman on the big screen.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUOH8_HYDtA">Cyrano mon Amour</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Good movie. Confirms my personal opinion about French movies:
these are generally the best movies when you look for a light but
tasty watch. The key of the French majesty of movies production is
to bring deep stories in a light way to the viewer while keeping
the importance of the message in the movie.
</p>

<p>
Here and there this specific movie falls into some mainstream,
which might hurt some more sophisticated viewer but generally a
good watch that underlines how sometimes the best in life does not
come by following rigid structures. 
</p>

<p>
Have to watch the Cyrano at some Opernhaus at some point now..
</p>

<p>
Also interesting is that now you can understand better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wnAnIM3cw">the song of
Guccini</a>. I understood the power of the text but some links where
missing and now it clicked.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGzKnyhYDQI">Loving Vincent</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. It is kind of a thriller. Recommended watch, just
because of the particular painting style it is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It is also a nice watch in the sense that you get easily
transported. 
</p>

<p>
Interesting way to talk about Van Gogh in this particular indirect
way. I think at the end they well manage to give a picture of him.
</p></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_a_d%C3%A9j%C3%A0_tes_yeux">Il a déjà tes yeux</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Very nice movie. Extremely funny. I love Manu. But also serious in
the topic. Without ever being too heavy. Very recommended.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYzFieit8dI">Mayerowitz Stories</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Well, there are many movies. Some are different. This is one of
these. Some movies you know from the very beginning what it is
gonna come. This not. It evolves and evolves and evolves and then
it finishes.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice family story.
</p></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRADS6wT3nc">Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
It talks about a nice story. It is a story about
integration. Again a typical french comedy. Sometimes fun,
sometimes serious and in general a very pleasant and constructive
watch.
</p>

<p>
The message of the story is the usual. But it is always good to
watch one more movie making the point. Myself as emigrant know
the point. Every time when moving out and entering a new
community you will face opposition. Don't think it is personal it
is just how the world spins. And if you are bright enough then you
will have the courage and the duty to oppose such mechanism and
promote different outcomes like the one in the movie. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKYaEPdcV1g&amp;t=3s">War Dogs</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
Dark comedy crime movie. Interesting cause it is based on a true
story. I generally do not like such kind of movies as they make
the watcher sympathize on bad behaviour by making it <i>hollywood
cool</i>. At the end you enjoy watching it but it is a double edge
sword for the reasons above. If you read it by taking a step back,
there is a learning also in such movie in how even an apparently
good soul as David gets easily tricked by the moment and takes up
bad habits. We all had that kind of Efraim friend.
</p>

<p>
So bottom line always remember that you are walking on thin ice
and it is easy to get out of track. Keep faith and stay solid on
good values. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTfYsODWQo">Stand by me</a> (1986):
</p>

<p>
I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was
twelve. Jesus, does anyone?
</p>

<p>
Good sentence as an end of the movie. Movie telling a simple
story. No big surprises. But still good. This is what simple
stories telling a piece of every child life can achieve. There is
no message but still the story is powerful. And the end makes the
message in the end, with a sentence - at the end. Nice movie.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GzCG6lpFUw&amp;t=57s">Vacanze Romane</a> (1953):
</p>

<p>
Was nice to see such an old movie. The story is outdated as in
2020 no one would ever come up with such a story. These were
rather fights from a previous generation.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe I guess that in some countries you would still have such
a story, what is different however is how the movie would be
interpreted. It would be more scenographic today, the message
would be more aggressive, more direct. 
</p>

<p>
This is a thing that I think got lost with respect to older
movies. They were more elegant and romantic. I do not know if it
was due to the fact that there was a different way to live the
public dimension in that age. They were different and this
difference emerges when watching such an old movie.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of my grand-dad, he used to have some of this
gentleman demeanor that is a leitmotiv in the movie. It got lost,
for better or for worse, replaced by a young wilder generation.

<li>check movies of Wes Anderson. I have no idea how he is. But one

into a movie of his. I love this song deeply. So I must at least
