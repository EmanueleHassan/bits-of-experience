<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKtvrvZC8OY">Il mondo che vorrei</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
This was an interview with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Francesco">Pope Francesco I</a>. It was a good
watch. In a rough world that is hard to navigate is always good to
listen to such people reminding the true christian values on which
the western society build on. These are not values augmenting the
individualism but rather stressing the importance of the community
that we must protect and remind us.
</p>

<p>
The message was centered about fostering a culture of <i>us</i> in
contrast to an <i>egocentric</i> view, in promoting a culture where we
have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhVsgxlYsEA">empathy</a> and care for the others. In refusing a culture of
waste, where if we do not like something, if something creates a
problem or if something/someone does not fit, well we throw it
away, be it a human being or a thing, instead of trying to solve
the problem with it.
</p>

<p>
Good fellow as always Pope Francesco, may he stay healthy.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En1jkf34xjc">La vita davanti a s√©</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Very good movie. Strong like Momo. It is a very mixed movie. It
encompasses many feelings and it is much food for thoughts. There
is not a bottom line to it and it is not a light watch where there
not need to be a bottom line. 
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to write a snippet summarizing it. I liked it. One
of the things I liked was the power of Momo. I guess that a key in
the movie is how the energy of such people when channeled in the
right will make them shine. The weird element of the lion in the
movie goes in this direction. There is a lion / fire in some
people and it can turn to very good or bad outcomes depending on
who is there in the path of such people - be it Madame Rosa or the
other guy.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is also to notice that not the spoiled child, but
rather the suffered one will have the fire. Help such people and
let them shine.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUOH8_HYDtA">Cyrano mon Amour</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Good movie. Confirms my personal opinion about French movies:
these are generally the best movies when you look for a light but
tasty watch. The key of the French majesty of movies production is
to bring deep stories in a light way to the viewer while keeping
the importance of the message in the movie.
</p>

<p>
Here and there this specific movie falls into some mainstream,
which might hurt some more sophisticated viewer but generally a
good watch that underlines how sometimes the best in life does not
come by following rigid structures. 
</p>

<p>
Have to watch the Cyrano at some Opernhaus at some point now..
</p>

<p>
Also interesting is that now you can understand better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wnAnIM3cw">the song of
Guccini</a>. I understood the power of the text but some links where
missing and now it clicked.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGzKnyhYDQI">Loving Vincent</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. It is kind of a thriller. Recommended watch, just
because of the particular painting style it is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It is also a nice watch in the sense that you get easily
transported. 
</p>

<p>
Interesting way to talk about Van Gogh in this particular indirect
way. I think at the end they well manage to give a picture of him.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKYaEPdcV1g&amp;t=3s">War Dogs</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
Dark comedy crime movie. Interesting cause it is based on a true
story. I generally do not like such kind of movies as they make
the watcher sympathize on bad behaviour by making it <i>hollywood
cool</i>. At the end you enjoy watching it but it is a double edge
sword for the reasons above. If you read it by taking a step back,
there is a learning also in such movie in how even an apparently
good soul as David gets easily tricked by the moment and takes up
bad habits. We all had that kind of Efraim friend.
</p>

<p>
So bottom line always remember that you are walking on thin ice
and it is easy to get out of track. Keep faith and stay solid on
good values. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTfYsODWQo">Stand by me</a> (1986):
</p>

<p>
I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was
twelve. Jesus, does anyone?
</p>

<p>
Good sentence as an end of the movie. Movie telling a simple
story. No big surprises. But still good. This is what simple
stories telling a piece of every child life can achieve. There is
no message but still the story is powerful. And the end makes the
message in the end, with a sentence - at the end. Nice movie.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GzCG6lpFUw&amp;t=57s">Vacanze Romane</a> (1953):
</p>

<p>
Was nice to see such an old movie. The story is outdated as in
2020 no one would ever come up with such a story. These were
rather fights from a previous generation.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe I guess that in some countries you would still have such
a story, what is different however is how the movie would be
interpreted. It would be more scenographic today, the message
would be more aggressive, more direct. 
</p>

<p>
This is a thing that I think got lost with respect to older
movies. They were more elegant and romantic. I do not know if it
was due to the fact that there was a different way to live the
public dimension in that age. They were different and this
difference emerges when watching such an old movie.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of my grand-dad, he used to have some of this
gentleman demeanor that is a leitmotiv in the movie. It got lost,
for better or for worse, replaced by a young wilder generation.
