<p>
So this is about a major trend in the insurance space.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the many posts in order to properly understand the
balance sheets of insurance companies that you will directly or
indirectly work with.
</p>

<p>
There is a strong trend in structuring products that merge classical
insurance products with more traditional market-side investment
exposure in equties and bonds.
</p>

<p>
This is in fact what you invested in when doing your 3b plan via life
insurance.

<h2 id="org9f388f8">Trend Reasoning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f388f8">
<p>
So I like the explaination for the trend as in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnsNqZ7730AhWX7rsIHYutD5gQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https://www.iaisweb.org/file/89238/2019-global-insurance-market-report-gimar&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xNWFUhVrMGTLPHefS8NpN&amp;cshid=1638199112851412">following
report</a> (Global Insurance Market Report 2019) - see chapter 3.3.
</p>

<p>
So basically the low interest rate - at the time of this writing
-0.3% yield on 10y German Government bond - have screwed up the
business model of insurance companies. Especially in the
life-insurance business with very long time-horizons.
</p>

<p>
As a reaction, insurance companies have lowered the guarantees they offer in
their contracts or promoted unit-linked contracts (which do not
provide return guarantees) due to the low interest rate environment.
</p>

<p>
The ULIP market has developed to offset decreasing interest rates
and limit the pressure on life insurers to match guaranteed payout
rates.  This has also affected the insurance-investment proportion of
ULIPs, with the latter increasing its relative share over time.

<h2 id="org84939ba">On the risk of such Products - Effects on Balance Sheet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org84939ba">
<p>
As the ULIP market has grown, assets under management linked to the
investment portion of the premiums are now mainly directly managed by
asset managers.
</p>

<p>
In the US, these products are referred to as separate accounts and
assets are typically invested in mutual funds. However, not all
annuities are linked to separate accounts.
</p>

<p>
The policyholder holds fund units and the net asset value is regularly
reported.  The market risk of the ULIP is solely borne by the
policyholder, although some products offer guarantees or minimum rates
of return.
</p>

<p>
This is the ultimate reason why such products deserve a different
treatment within the balance sheet of your group. The risk does not
immediately affect the risk of your house and the impact on the
balance sheet of these instruments on your house balance sheet is
not comparable to the one of other instruments.
</p>

<p>
That's all folks for the moment. I am sure that in 1h I did not
manage to capture all of the complexity of these kind of instruments
on your house-risk but at least you have a more basics understanding
of them and when you hear talking about them you should be able to
frame the discussion in a more sensible way.
