This post deals with music theory.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 
</p>

<p>
But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.
</p>

<p>
This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 
</p>

<p>
The general idea - in music and life is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026; But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 
</p>

<p>
After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.

<p>
Everything in music can be reduced to intervals (or distances
between notes) and their relationships.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org919b942">
<p>
Recall all of the physics is contained in music:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Everything in nature is energy vibrating at different frequencies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So is sound - it is waves travelling through a medium - often
air. A specific sound has a pitch (the wavelength) - measuring the
frequency of the sound - and an amplitude - measuring the strength
of the sound.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-01-22 210323.png" class="center">

<p>
Recall as well that the human being has the capacity of hearing
sound in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. You always move in this
space so to say.
</p>

<p>
A note is then a specific named pitch. Aside from the pitch, notes
have other defining qualities - such as: <b>time duration</b>,
<b>loudness</b> and <b>quality</b>.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it you have the concept of <b>timbre</b>. This is a sound
color that comes from different instruments. For instance, a C
note on a piano is the same as a C note on a violin but we
experience them differently due to the different timbre.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> what we hear as a single note is actually a <i>whole
spectrum</i> of related higher frequencies coming from the
instrument, that our ears perceive, more or less, as a single
frequency. This is part of the reason why different instruments
have different <i>timbres</i>.

In a sense, studying harmony and melody boils down to studying
pitch and the relationships between different pitches.
</p>

<p>
The relationships between pitches are called intervals.

<h3 id="org21a9268">On Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org21a9268">
<p>
There are <b>12</b> notes in Western music.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A, A# or Bb, B, C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, E, F, F# or Gb, G, G#
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As you are learning the piano now - make sure you have the system
well in your mind. 
</p>

<p>
Note as well that there are no sharps or flats between B-C and
E-F. Once you have this well into your mind it will help you to
quickly find your way on the piano and will help you to navigate
the octaves and the different notes positions quickly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Exercise</i>: try to make sense of it at some stage and understand
why it turned out exactly like this.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that the notes without sharps or flats are called
<b>natural notes</b> in western tradition.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind the note circle in this sense. You will have to work
with it - it hides the structure of the tetrahedron that you still
have to figure out.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-01-22 224313.png" class="center">

<p>
Note that when you move clockwise you go higher in pitch. You use
the sharp notation in this case (#). When you move
counterclockwise you go lower in pitch. You use the flat notation
in this case (b).

<p>
Note that in western music you have 12 notes. These cover the
entire spectrum of listenable sound 20 Hz - 20 kHz.
</p>

<p>
In this sense notes are repeated in <b>higher and lower registers</b>.
You are very familiar with the concept simply by checking at a
piano.
</p>

<p>
Note that the distance between two notes in adjacents registers is
<b>an octave</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note that two notes distanced by an octave have the property that
taking a starting and ending point the amount of waves halves /
doubles exactly.

<p>
Musicians needed some standard at some point to tune their
instruments and play together based on some reference value.
</p>

<p>
This brought up the concept of Standard Pitch or Concert Pitch.
</p>

<p>
This sets the A note above middle C (C4) to vibrate at 440 Hz.

<h3 id="org2718f13">On the 12-tone equal temperament and octave subdivision</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2718f13">
<p>
Note that once you have a tuning note set to some frequency the
question is on how to divide the frequency notes in an octave.
</p>

<p>
Here comes in the idea of equal temperament. 
</p>

<p>
You have 12 notes in an octave considering the sharps and
flats. The idea is then to divide the range of an octave given by
the ratios of 2 into 12 equal components.
</p>

<p>
<b>Each components equals a semitone</b>.
</p>

<p>
You will see then why you have two times two notes without a sharp
or a flat. This in order to stay with <b>6 tones for an octave</b> but
keep the 7 distinct natural notes.
</p>

<p>
Note that above it is stated that the octave is divided into 12
equal parts. How the "equality" is defined is tricky. It is not
equal in the <b>linear</b> scala but rather in the <b>logarithmic</b> scala.
</p>

<p>
Think about this; would it be linear you would divide the 2-factor
interval between two "equal" notes in the following way:
</p>

<p>
2/12 = 1/6 = 0.166666&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Meaning each note would be would distanced by a factor: 1.1666666
</p>

<p>
But the 12 - TET divides the two factor interval in the following
way:
</p>

<p>
12th root of 2 = 1.05
</p>
