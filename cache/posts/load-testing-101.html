So basically you have your PoC concept for the solution right now.
I stress that it is a PoC. Have to take some time to fix some
architectural components that I have in mind. 
</p>

<p>
There are still a couple of things I have to sort out at conceptual
level.
</p>

<p>
These belong more to the SRE field but, well you know, here it's a
special breed of a team. You have to deal with everything by your own.
</p>

<p>
So the thing is that I have now a multi-threaded PoC performing the
solution. I want to test now the threading component and to test
different gunicorn webserver settings.
</p>

<p>
In the specific I want to stress the system and see how it performs,
meaning how many threads is a good number of threads and when the
performance starts to go bust.
</p>

<p>
For this I am starting to dig into load testing tools.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
A tool that is quick and dirty and which I am starting with is <code>Apache
Bench</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="orgb0c6d3b">Apache Bench</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0c6d3b">
<p>
This is a quite easy tool.
</p>

<p>
You should get it out of the box if you are working in UNIX
environments.
</p>

<p>
You can check at how to properly work with it by checking the man
page for the command.
</p>

<p>
The two most important parameters are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>-n</code>: with it you can specify the number of requests to perform.</li>

<li><code>-c</code>: this is the concurrency parameter. With it you can specify
how many concurrent requests you wish to make.</li>

<li><code>-s</code>: this is potentially as well interesting. With it you can
change the default timeout for each response. This is fixed at
30s. This is not the bottleneck for your designed solution right
now. But in any case you should keep it in the back of your
mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note as well that you have all of the authentication properties and
you have as well the possibility to ship post requests.
</p>

<p>
This is currently not working with POST request. So testing the
thing with get. I mean for understanding the lower level stuff of
your server and understanding the behaviour it plays no big role. 
</p>

<p>
Would have to understand why and fix it.

<h2 id="orgf96ecdc"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> JMeter</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf96ecdc">
<p>
Did not really start to explore it in a thorough way.
</p>

<p>
Just understood so far that is a more solid tool in order to make
solid tests.
</p>

<p>
Google it should you be interested in it. You might start from <a href="https://www.guru99.com/jmeter-performance-testing.html">here</a>.
