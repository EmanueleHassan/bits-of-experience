Last week I set up my working laptop and the SSH key to access my
private working github repository.
</p>

<p>
A question arise: <i>How to add an additional SSH-key to modify the
content on my public github registry?</i>

As usual a simple query to my favorite research engine solved the
issue. I refer therefore to the following blog post well outlining the
solution for the issue: <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574">multiple keys for different accounts</a>.
</p>

<p>
The trick is rather simple. It basically consists of creating a
separate pair of ssh-keys to the one in use for connecting to your
working github account, register them on your github as in the
standard case and finally to create a configuration file in your
<code>.ssh</code> directory and specify two different Hosts associated with the
two different ssh-keys pairs. 
</p>

<p>
At this stage you are set and when dealing with github repositories
you simply have to specify, which of the two Hosts keys you intend to
use. (In case of using a default account you can even skip the
specification if you aim to use that account.)
</p>

<p>
An example might then adding a repository according to the host of choice:
</p>

<p>
<code>git remote add origin git@&lt;your chosen Host&gt;:&lt;your git file&gt;</code>
</p>

It recently happened to me that I had to work on a project on a remote
machine with multiple people.
</p>

<p>
Of course I could create a gitlab repository and push the files from
my computer to the gitlab branch. Then go on the remote machine for
testing and pull the changes pushed there. 
</p>

<p>
It is rather bumpy, so I preferred to code directly on the remote
machine in <code>tramp mode</code> and test directly the stuff over there. The
issue now was on how to have different users act remotely and have
different ways to call different ssh keys when pushing so that we
could differentiate who was editing and avoid the clutter of everyone
pushing with the same ssh-keys.
</p>

<p>
Turned out the solution was in <a href="https://noamlewis.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/git-admin-an-alias-for-running-git-commands-as-a-privileged-ssh-identity/">this post</a>. Very well written and neat
integration. No other words to be said.

So turning this post from a pure git post into something more.
</p>

<p>
Basically I did set up the various private-github and working laptop
keys.
</p>

<p>
The only thing you should be careful is that in Bitbucket you have
a per project set-up.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you have to register your working laptop public key per project
in the access key tab.
</p>

<p>
Then you will be able to easily publish there everything properly.
