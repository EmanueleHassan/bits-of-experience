I recently had to write a documentation on how to leverage the IBM
Data Shield service. This is a very powerful tool to convert any
docker image into SGX-architecture complaint images that can run on
SGX enabled processors.

This is a very powerful tool in order to increase the achievable
security level on public clouds and might foster new business models
on public clouds.
