<p>
So this post will prove as a repository for work around accounting
terms and concepts.
</p>

<p>
Lots and part of the cake is this translation from accounting measures
to economic ones through which you manage your stuff.
</p>

<p>
The way this translation is done is important as it is quite core if
you want to get a thorough picture.
</p>

<p>
So this post contains some information in this dimension. As always
will start in a very light way and see if it grows then in time -
i.e. see if I come a lot across these concepts.
</p>

<p>
There is also all that big stuff of IFRS17 and IFRS9. Would be cool to
watch a quick video of it&#x2026; take time at some point. Just to have a
high level understanding of that and what it is going on in this
sense.
</p>

<p>
This is important as, as mentioned in the RiskMetics paper:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
</p>

<p>
Only a limited number of trading items are marked to market.

<p>
Accruals are revenues earned or expenses incurred which impact a
company's net income on the income statement, although cash related
to the transaction has not yet changed hands. Accruals also affect
the balance sheet, as they involve non-cash assets and
liabilities. Accrual accounts include, among many others, accounts
payable, accounts receivable, accrued tax liabilities, and accrued
interest earned or payable.
