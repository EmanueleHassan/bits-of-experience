I discovered I was filmed when holding a presentation. I share the
video here. I consider this one of my greatest university
accomplishments as I discuss a paper I discovered which I think is
very powerful and every person should reason of the content presented
here reaching his/her personal conclusions.

<p>
Please watch below the video if interested. It talks about recruitment
as a very powerful social mechanism giving rise to very complex
dynamical structures.

<p>
Errata Corrige: <i>notice that when talking about the markov chains in
the talk I did not make the point explicit enough.</i>

<p>
The idea is the following:
</p>

<p>
the transition kernel described give rise to a reversible
stationary distribution. Given this we know that an invariant
distribution exists.
</p>

<p>
Given the irresistibility property of the chain we know then that such
an invariant distribution must be unique and that we will converge to
it no matter the initial distribution.
