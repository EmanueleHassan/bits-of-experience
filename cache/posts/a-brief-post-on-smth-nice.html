So I was working - of course with a bit of music. Those who know me
well know that I cannot work in the silence. I never did that, even
when studying highly theoretical material I must feel my blood flowing
and set my mind free. Just then I can enter my working mood properly.

<p>
So this time I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOyfLBYtuU&amp;list=RDMMxWx3R7WaAQY&amp;index=28">this song</a> and something beautiful
occurred.

I started to read the comments as I always do on youtube. I really
like the platform because without being followed by all the people
that know you, people write more sincerely there. People meet in a
semi-random way just based on emotions or interests.
</p>

<p>
And boom - the comment section of that song is just mind blowing. It
is incredible the strength of music. A simple song. You listen it in a
distributed fashion - each one by himself in his room. And badaboom -
suddenly everyone wants to share very personal and deep experiences.
</p>

<p>
And you there on the other side of the world without knowing the
people can take part to the sorrow and wish all of these people the
best. Understanding on the top of it how each people is different and
how some had to face tougher fights than others&#x2026;
