<p>
This are some notes on Helm.
</p>

<p>
Recently I have downloaded a chart. I will have to change the
configurations of this.
</p>

<p>
I will have to configure static IP for the internal application
running in kubernetes such that my service will be externally
accessible. 
</p>

<p>
Here some notes based on that and some commands.
</p>

<p>
I will expand on this in the future depending how much I will have to
work with it.

First of all it makes sense to look at the deployed chart.
</p>

<p>
You can get all of the info regarding your deployed chart via
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  helm get all &lt;chart-name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
There the output might be especially long.
</p>

<p>
In this sense you can also restrict the view to the manifest, say
with
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  helm get manifest &lt;chart-name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
That will likely also be long. This depending on the complexity of
the chart.

A good idea to start with helm is to read this <a href="http://technosophos.com/2017/03/23/how-helm-uses-configmaps-to-store-data.html">entry</a>.
</p>

<p>
There it is still based on tiller and v2 but it should give you a
basic idea.
