This entry contains some notes about setting up a CI pipeline. I will
explore especially the <code>Jenkins</code> option and I will integrate it with
Python.
</p>

<p>
After setting up the architecture for a project it is important now to
set up such processes such that we will work with the proper tooling
and will not loose too much time integrating versions over time.

Integration and Delivery: A Concise Guide with Examples</a>.

You can refer to this book should you want a more in depth discussion
of the material covered here.

<p>
Note that the CI software will run on a server. This server must have
access to your code base. It is therefore standard for companies to
have the CI software run on on-premise servers such that the precious
code-base will never leave the company.
</p>

<p>
Interesting in this sense would be to see how that integrates in
cloud-native environments. 
</p>

<p>
Most CI software has a central server component that can poll source
code repositories for changes and that can also be triggered by
hooks. If a change in the source code repository is detected, this
triggers a job. The job can either be configured centrally in the
server or in the source code repository.
</p>

<p>
This is the general idea of CI pipeline. Trigger jobs that check if
you manage to build your application and that checks whether the
different tests pass. All of this in an automatic way such that you
will immediately notified if when changing some of your code base you
trigger changes that are not in line and disrupt the different tests.
</p>

<p>
Once the CI server knows <code>which tests to execute</code>, and in <code>which
environments</code>, it typically delegates the actual test runs to worker
nodes. The worker nodes then report their results back to the server,
which takes care of sending notifications and making the outputs and
results available for inspection through a web interface.
</p>

<p>
Usually, in a production environment, you’d run the Jenkins server on
one machine and have several build workers on different (virtual)
machines. For the sake of easy setup, we’ll forego this sensible
distinction and run the server and all build jobs within the same
Docker container, just to have fewer docker containers to manage.

<h2 id="orge8e3df9">Setting up Jenkins in Docker</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge8e3df9">
<p>
This is fairly standard. Just create your docker image for it and
deploy it.
</p>

<p>
One such image could be for instance:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd5daefc">
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
USER root
RUN apt-get update \
    &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python-pip python3.5 \
    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN pip install tox
</pre>


<p>
Then simply build the image
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  docker build -t jenkins-python .
</pre></div>

<p>
Make sure it is then listed on your docker engine
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  docker image ls
</pre></div>


<p>
And finally deploy it
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  docker run --rm -p <span class="m">8080</span>:8080 -p <span class="m">50000</span>:50000 <span class="se">\ </span>    
    -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins-python
</pre></div>
</div>

<h2 id="org4c329ed">First Jenkins Job</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4c329ed">
<p>
Jenkins jobs are where you specify your integration triggers.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that once you specify your jenkins triggers - these can
be for instance a push to the github branch etc. -, and the build
configuration i.e. what you perform when a job is triggered - this
can be for instance a python command.

Check also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW_bADC2fFM&amp;t=834s">this</a> video to see how to complete the pipeline in the
using a <code>Jenkinsfile</code>. I liked this video better as there is a clear
structure in there and on how to proceed.
