Recently, I heard about the Monty Hall problem. Smth felt wrong and I
was chased by it in the last days. I think it attacks the very roots
of statistical thinking and I claim that the standard answer - switch
door - is poor.  If interested you can read about the problem on
wikipedia and continue.

I simply claim that it makes no sense to use a probability measure to
base your decision in such a one time played win all/loose all game.
</p>

<p>
The “standard” probability measures, such as the one used as an
argumentation in the Monty Hall problem, rely on frequency arguments
and work very well asymptotically. They are helpful to model an
aleatoric problem. For instance it would be correct to always switch,
if the problem was repeated X times as then LLN would chick in and on
expectation you would be better off. 
</p>

<p>
It is however wrong to model epistemic problems with them; Ferrari or
sheep. There is no frequency argumentation. We live in a single state.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line. Neyman, Fisher and Pearson developed a wonderful
science around the frequency theory with many elegant asymptotic
Results. They gave us a weapon, however we cannot use that for each
and every case.
</p>

<p>
Albeit this is 85% of the statistics it is thought in academia and our
lives, it is not the only road and one better starts to consider
alternative frameworks for modeling the problem. Moreover, I claim
that the problem underlines the necessity to question the problem
before applying statistical brute force evaluation to it.
</p>

<p>
We should always understand the nature of the problem and try to
classify it as an aleatoric or epistemic one and accordingly model it
with the different statistical frameworks.
