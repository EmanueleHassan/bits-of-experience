So far we introduced data objects in their tree format. We saw that
being HDFS agnostic you can save data in their tree shape - be it
<code>JSON</code> or <code>XML</code> - in <code>HDFS</code>. We see how it was possible to operate on
such tree data directly via the pyspark RDD low level API. Moreover,
we briefly tackled the idea of compressing the information in the tree
data model into dataframes and on how to handle these via <code>sparkSQL</code>
with its <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/spark-session-initalization/">explode operators</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we addressed document stores, <code>NoSQL</code> databases that are
especially designed to deal with data in their tree shape. We saw the
extent to which document stores rely on indices and the consequent
benefit over HDFS when it comes to find indexed data as no scan over
the entire dataset has to be executed.
</p>

<p>
Given the interesting case for document store but the limited
scalability the question is on whether we could leverage data
independence for using a <b>declarative language</b> in a similar spirit of
the <b>SQL</b> that is appositely created to deal with tree-modeled data. 
</p>

<p>
This posts confronts with the above case and introduces a <b>Jsoniq</b> one
of the many languages that are emerging in this Big Data decade to
deal with tree-modeled data in a declarative way. This will allow to
deal with tree-data without having to use the low-level RDD API or the
approximative mapping of the tree structure into dataframes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2540b1d">
<p>
As said the idea that is gaining traction in the last years is to
develop a declarative language that leveraging the modular
architecture of the storage and compute engines technologies is able
to work and run on top of major frameworks with a unified syntax
without the need for the user to understand the technologies running
in the background lower in the stack.

As said many languages are currently emerging trying to deal with the
issue described above. Some of them are:

<p>
They are mostly comparable to each other. We will deal in the post
with <code>Jsoniq</code> and <code>Rumble</code> a Java library that directly leverages
on Jsoniq.

<p>
As said the goal was the one of finding a declarative language that
would allow the user to deal with the
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nestedness</li>

<li>heterogeneity</li>
</ul>

<p>
of data in their tree shape.
</p>

<p>
<code>Jsoniq</code> is a declarative, functional language that tries the above. 
</p>

<p>
It is declarative in the sense that it abstracts the user from
defining the <b>how</b> to achieve and manipulate the data to the low level
in order to arrive at the desired result; you merely specify <b>what</b>
you want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
It is a functional language in the sense that it manipulates instances
into instances via functions. I.e. anything in the language modifies
instances into instances.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is a set-based language meaning that it acts on and returnsb
collections rather than single objects.
</p>

<p>
In this sense in the Jsoniq data models, data are represented as a
<b>sequence</b> of heterogenous and denormalized items. Denormalized in the
sense that in each item in the sequence there might be nested a
further sequence of items. Notice, that the case of a single data
point is also modeled as a <b>sequence</b> of items composed by a single
item. Recall that Jsoniq is a set-based language in this sense.
</p>

<p>
On top of that it is important to understand that sequences are flat
so that when to object that form a sequence are concatenated to
another sequence the result is a single sequence.

<img width="40%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-27_um_10.26.58.png" class="center">

<p>
Jsoniq has 4 different types of items:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>atomic items - i.e scalars, strings etc. -</li>
<li>objects <code>{}</code></li>
<li>arrays <code>[]</code></li>
<li>functions <i>F (sequence of items)</i></li>
</ul>
