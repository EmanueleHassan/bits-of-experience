<p>
This file contains some notes on different programming paradigms.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to write down here some major <i>concepts</i> without going too
much into the details and looking at the specific syntax of any
language.
</p>

<p>
I like this approach as it is important to have a clear idea of
meta-structures when working. These tackle the core of the issue
without being tight to the complexity of particular languages. This
will help you to make a clear cut and learn systematically and
fundamentally the core structures such that it will be possible to you
to create fundamentally solid design blueprints on which you can
expand later on.

<h2 id="org894ac42">Procedural</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org894ac42">
<p>
The idea of procedural programming is that you specify functions
based on the <i>procedural design</i> of your implementation.
</p>

<p>
This means that each separate procedure requires a different
function.
</p>

<p>
Note that this goes well along with the TDD you studied
recently. There the idea was pretty much identically to specify each
time a desired use-case, write tests for it, make them fail and
based on this write code until you pass all of the desired tests for
the specific feature.

<div id="outline-container-org608031f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org608031f">Object Oriented</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org608031f">
<p>
In contrast to <i>procedural programming</i>, <i>object oriented
programming</i> is slightly different as paradigm. Here the idea is to
group code together based on the abstract idea of objects.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that each object possesses both <i>attributes</i> and
<i>behaviours</i> and you specify both within an object <i>class</i>.
</p>

<p>
Four key concepts that allows object oriented programming to be
effective and allows a rich modeling possibility are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>encapsulation</li>

<li>inheritance</li>

<li>polymorphism</li>

<li>composition</li>
</ul>


<p>
Notice moreover one <b>very important</b> property of object oriented
programming. Here you allow object to contain <i>attributes</i>, meaning
that the concept of "data" is <b>tightly</b> bounded to objects such
that you can precisely govern the data accessibility.
</p>

<p>
This stands in sharp contrast to structural programming where you
have a clear cut between functions / behaviours and the data, which
possesses global structure.
</p>

<p>
Note that given such a basic structure you can already start to
make sense of the first concepts.
</p>

<p>
I.e. given the data stored as <i>attributes</i> in the objects and given
the behaviours stored as <i>methods</i> in to the objects you can work
with the two together in tandem - i.e. in a coupled way - using
methods to alter objects attributes. This is in fact the concept of
<b>encapsulation</b> in OOP.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that the option to make some internal behaviour
<i>private</i> and just expose some methods has some flavor of the
concept of REST API. You just expose some method which gives back
some result and do not care about the internals of the code and how
some results are obtained.
</p>

<p>
Let's turn to the concept of <i>polymorphism</i>, here the idea is
essentially to say that a superclass specifies a method, however it
does not specify the code to perform the task. This will be
specified in the derived class, such that when you create an object
that belongs to the general superclass you will have the method
available that will adapt to the specific use case depending on the
derived class.
</p>

<p>
In an example this basically means the following:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4904a72">
For example, consider the Shape class and the behavior called
draw. When you tell somebody to draw a shape, the first question
asked is, “What shape?” No one can draw a shape, because it is an
abstract concept (in fact, the draw method in the Shape code
following contains no implementation). You must specify a concrete
shape. To do this, you provide the actual implementation in
Circle. Even though Shape has a draw method, Circle overrides this
method and provides its own draw method. Overriding basically means
replacing an implementation of a parent with one from a child.
</pre>

<p>
So it is basically an overwriting exercise.
