<h2 id="org2cc3477">On some poorly tasting jokes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cc3477">
<p>
So yesterday at work I was addressed with some jokes.
</p>

<p>
I was told:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Whatâ€™s worse than having a worm in your apple?
</p>

<p>
Having half a worm in your apple and the other in your mouth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is an <a href="https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/whats_worse_than_finding_a_worm_in_your_apple_the_holocaust">anti joke</a> for it. Poor taste the anti joke,
giving the story of my broader family.
</p>

<p>
Thanks G-d I am alive. Which brings me to the second joke I was
told.

We should cherish to be alive. Let's conclude with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yZVweZ2Cvg">bit of music</a>.

<p>
The truth is that I am scared. I am scared for the health of my
family. And when you are scared your brain seeks help, it is
psychological literature. In my case, shelter in religion and
judaism.
</p>

<p>
This is the thing. I am obsessed by judaism by now. I see judaism
everywhere. I see encrypted judaism messages everywhere. They tell
you two jokes and you google the meaning and find judaism and the
story of your anchestors in it.
</p>

<p>
I am shifting these posts back in history as I know that jews are
not welcomed by many people. I partially hide them. Some people
tell me that you should not be afraid. That companies are bounded
by law not to discriminate because of religion. I hope that this is
true.
</p>

<p>
After all this is the history of Yisrael. Bounded to fight with
G-d and survive. Always <i>Am Yisrael Chai</i>.
