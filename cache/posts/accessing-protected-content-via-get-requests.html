Sometimes when I want to make notes I prefer to download an html file,
transform it to an <code>.org</code> file via <code>pandoc</code> and to edit and make notes
in org mode. 
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless if the technique works fine for non-protected HTML pages,
sometimes you are required to pass some authorization variables to
access a page. This post outline my solution to deal with the latter case.

<p>
In this case you might want to authenticate on your browser, open for
instance the google developer tool, copy the file of interest into
your org file.
</p>

<p>
The solution is however quite tedious, especially if you have multiple
sites you want to download. A simpler solution is to open the google
developer tool and go under the networking settings. There you can
select the GET request to the server for your desired page.
</p>

<p>
Once you click on the request, that usually might be easily identified
in the network as it consumes the most of the bandwidth, you can
select the <code>Headers</code> tab and you can inspect the authorization, and
cookie headers passed with the GET request. 
</p>

<p>
You can finally save such headers in a <code>.json</code> and pass it with all of
your <code>GET</code> requests to your desired webpages. 
</p>

<p>
A minimal python script to do that is as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">json</span>

<span class="c1"># both &#39;x-test&#39; and &#39;x-test2&#39; are sent</span>


<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/Users/marcohassan/Desktop/prova_header.json&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">json_file</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">json_file</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hbase-the-definitive/xxxxxxx/ch01.html&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">headers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span> 

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/Users/marcohassan/Desktop/prova.html&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
To convert to the html to an org file you can finally run in your
shell
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pandoc -o prova.org -f html -t org prova.html 
</pre></div>
