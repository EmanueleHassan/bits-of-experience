<p>
So this tries to summarize a bit the concepts around RiskMetrics.
</p>

<p>
This is the industry standard in order to compute the risk numbers
etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that the notes are based on <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mappings-motivation/">the following publication</a>. Lots of
the statistical concepts are just a mere high level refresher. You
even checked at more sophisticated methods during your studies - see
for instance the GARCH and multivariate GARCH models.
</p>

<p>
So lots of the material is skipped in these notes. Just saving the
interesting parts of it that do not add to the rest. Interesting was
especially the brief section <a href="#org65def7e">From ALM to VaR</a>. This is a thing that I
definitely have to understand better and the current location of the
industry and of the company in this dimension.
</p>

<p>
Important is as well to better understand that transition from
accounting values to market values. This is an entire very important
space that I have no clue about. Not so in line with my interests
cause I never liked too much accounting as a subject, but if you do
not understand that piece of the cake you might as well not loose time
in understanding all of the rest as everything starts from there.

<h2 id="org2f463a6">Basics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2f463a6">
<p>
RiskMetrics has three basic components:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A set of market risk measurement methodologies outlined in this
document.</li>

<li>Data sets of volatility and correlation data used in the
computation of market risk.</li>

<li>Software systems developed by J.P.Morgan, subsidiaries of Reuters,
and third party vendors  that implement the methodologies described herein.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you see the source of your confusion. The modeling part is just
but one of the components of the RiskMetrics system. The other two
components are part of it and that is the difference between the
pure VaR component and this one.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org9dfdd29" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9dfdd29">History</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9dfdd29">
<p>
Interesting is to read about the <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/riskmetrics/">RiskMetrics history</a> as well and
how it came to be. Now you are in the industry. 40 years ahead more
less. Sky is the limit - always - cause you point to 100 and you
will get 30 if you know what I mean :). 
</p>

<p>
So basically as mentioned a couple of time we go with the RiskMetrics
JP Morgan model that the entire industry is using. When you have time
it will be worth to start digging into <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5915b101-4206-4ba0-aee2-3449d5c7e95a">this one as well</a> - this will
give you a more solid understanding of it and you will be able to
start drawing bechmarks to what you have in place here.

<div id="outline-container-org970079d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org970079d">On the data distributed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org970079d">
<p>
Daily recomputed data sets which are comprehensive sets of
consistently estimated instrument level VaRs (i.e., 1.65 standard
deviations) and correlations across a large number of asset
classes and instruments.
</p>

<p>
We currently distribute three different data sets over the
Internet: one for short term trading risks, the second for
intermediate term investment risks and the third for regulatory
reporting. These are made available to the market free of charge.

<h3 id="org7187c54">Workflow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7187c54">
<p>
The workflow in RiskMetrics is essentially the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 085036.png" class="center">

<p>
So this is maybe performed by the external provider we use when
getting the relevant simulations.    
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org65def7e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org65def7e">From ALM to VaR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65def7e">
<p>
There is already this interesting chapter over here. Cause you have
to understand if this is a little bit the idea of the ALM in your
team or if it has nothing to do with it.
</p>

<p>
I think it does, at least partially. Probably and most likely not
completely. So cool, you also covered a little bit more of
understanding in this sense. You understand now what it is going
on.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that just for some items you can actually <b>mark to
market</b> and do all of your relevant calculations from there.
</p>

<p>
But in general:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5899106" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5899106">Basically you have ALM and Market Risk</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5899106">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For ALM the workflow is essentially the following:</li>
</ul>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 094942.png" class="center">

<li>For Market risk the workflow is essentially the following:</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgbc35cc1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbc35cc1">On the complications that this brings along</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbc35cc1">
<p>
Check at the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The distinction between accrual items and trading items and their
separate treatment for market risk management has led to significant
complications—particularly when transactions classified as “trading
items” under generally accepted accounting principles are used to
hedge transactions classified as “accrual items”.
</p>

<p>
In an effort to overcome this difficulty, many firms – particularly
those with relatively large trading books have expanded the market
risk approach to also include accrual items, at least for internal
risk management reporting. This is done by estimating the fair market
value of the accrual items and the changes in their fair value under
different short term scenarios. Thus we are witnessing the evolution
of an alternative to the conventional approach of Asset/Liability
Management, the Value-at-Risk approach. It started in pure trading
operations, but is now gaining increased following in the financial
industry.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ok so you see&#x2026; I  think that the latter is what is going on in
our team.
</p>

<p>
So have to understand if there is still part of the conventional
ALM model or if everything was converted into the VaR approach.
</p>

<p>
I guess so. Maybe ask Massimo. Anyways check at the general
overview next.

<h3 id="orgee0d0dc">Steps in the framework fo modern financial management</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgee0d0dc">
<p>
Basically the thing looks as follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 103720.png" class="center">

<p>
So you see that the thing below is exactly what it is happening in
our team.
</p>

<p>
So you see that it is always important to read into the general
literature that you find online. It will give you this high level
understanding of what is going on that your team is not managing
to provide you.
</p>

<p>
On <i>the valuation compoenent</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To value transactions for which, in the absence of a liquid
secondary market, no market value exists, we first map them into
equivalent positions, or decompose them into parts for which
secondary market prices exist. The most basic such “part” is a
single cash flow with a given maturity and currency of the
payor. Most transactions can be described as a combination of such
cash flows and thus can be valued approximately as the sum of
market values of their component cash flows.
</p>


<p>
Only non-marketable items that contain options cannot be valued in
this simple manner. For their valuation we also need expected
volatilities and correlations of the prices and rates that affect
their value, and we need an options pricing model. Volatilities
describe potential movements in rates with a given probability;
correlations describe the interdependencies between different
rates and prices. Thus, for some valuations, we require
volatilities and correlations.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8b24ee6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8b24ee6">Different types of Simulation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8b24ee6">
<p>
Again, there are different types of ways to parametrize the VaR.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org4950771" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4950771">RiskMetrics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4950771">
<p>
RiskMetrics uses historical time series analysis to derive
estimates of volatilities and correlations on a large set of
financial instruments.
</p>

<p>
It assumes that the distribution of past returns can be modelled
to provide us with a reasonable forecast of future returns over
different horizons.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org524a277" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org524a277">Historical Simulation Approach</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org524a277">
<p>
On the official documentation it is written that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The historical simulation approach, which is usually applied under a
full valuation model, makes no explicit assumptions about the
distribution of asset returns.
</p>

<p>
Under historical simulation, portfolios are valued under a number of
different historical time windows which are user defined.
</p>

<p>
These lookback periods typically range from 6 months to 2 years.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How these scenarios are generated varies across models, from basic
historical simulation to distributions of returns generated from a
set of volatility and correlation estimates such as RiskMetrics.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org773ac68" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org773ac68">Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org773ac68">
<p>
This is the concept you know well. Use it when you cannot
establish a clear distribution for your return in order to compute
your VaR measure.
</p>

<p>
This is usally done in combination to the historical simulation
approach described above that would ultimately yield you the
desired unknown distribution.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org6c7d2c4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6c7d2c4">Implied Volatilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c7d2c4">
<p>
You can check at them to get a forward looking volatility estimate
based on the market price of the derivatives on a given
instrument.
</p>

<p>
In such a way you do not have to rely on the historical values for
the vola. The issue is that it is not always possible to get to
the relevant implicit volatilities as there are not always
derivatives for every underlying of interest.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org1e1de5d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1e1de5d">User Defined Curves</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e1de5d">
<p>
This is the way to add the relevant scenarios (in the insurance
space) or stress tests (in the banking space) in order to make the
relevant topside adjustments to your model based risk numbers.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org63d5ae7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org63d5ae7">Determining the way you express your risk</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org63d5ae7">
<p>
This is as well another important mental game that is important to
play.
</p>

<p>
Just in such a way you can set the things into perspective and you
can manage to understand the right kind of questions without taking
everything at face value.
</p>

<p>
Understand the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Position limits have traditionally been expressed in nominal terms,
futures equivalents or other denominators unrelated to the amount of
risk effectively incurred.
</p>

<p>
[Say for instance the manager of a USD bond portfolio was told:]
</p>

<p>
100 million limit is in 2-year equivalents.
</p>

<p>
Now, setting limits in terms of Value-at-Risk has significant advantages:
position benchmarks become a function of risk and positions in
different markets while products can be <b>compared through this common
measure</b>. A common denominator rids the standard limits manuals of a
multitude of measures which are different for every asset class.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that it is mentioned in the Riskmetrics paper the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-13 184208.png" class="center">

<p>
I do not agree very much with this statement. This is why you
actually learn in academia that ES is a superior risk metrics. It
is good in this sense how we operate.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdbd00c2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdbd00c2">Mapping securities to cash flows</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdbd00c2">
<p>
You can read <a href="https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5915b101-4206-4ba0-aee2-3449d5c7e95a">chapter 6 on these notes</a>.
</p>

<p>
You see for instance there the general logic of converting all of
the different types of instruments in cash flows.
</p>

<p>
This exercise is also happening on our side. For lots of
instruments the marking to market is trivial. For others it is a
little bit more difficult. I mean at the end it is quite trivial
decomposing but still the decomposition is necessary.

Again another interesting input. Check the following:

You see that with proper risk numbers you can estimate and render
more valuable statistics that can be used in order to track the
performance of the traders.

Would be interesting in this sense to understand what the manager
selection team does in this dimension. Which metrics are used? Who
produces them? Go and talk with the person you know.
