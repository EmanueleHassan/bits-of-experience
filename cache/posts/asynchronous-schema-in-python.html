<p>
This post briefly summarizes the learnings from this <a href="https://realpython.com/python-async-features/#reader-comments">other post</a>. Read
it if you have time before reading this, as I intend to keep this
quite short and juicy.  
</p>

<p>
I really liked that post, it did give me some overview of some new
methods in python I was not aware of.
</p>

<p>
Get familiar with the terms in the article. Albeit these article are
101, the terms are pretty much in line with the wider literature.
</p>

<p>
Note that this post sum-up is basically about asynchronous programming
via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking">cooperative multitasking</a>. This is in contrast to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/preemptive-multitasking#:~:text=Preemptive%20multitasking%20is%20task%20in,another%20task%20is%20called%20preempting.">preemptive
multitasking</a> which is used by OS-level threading mechanism as done via
the <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-multithreading/">Threading</a> module in Python.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
So after reading a little bit it, I think that all of the methods
presented here are nice tricks that can solve corner situations that
are not too complex. I still think that if you properly manage
multi-threading programming you would still come out with the best set
of modeling possibilities. This at the expense of increased complexity.
</p>

<p>
The methods described here are useful though, cause you can tactically
use them here and there for quick strategic wins in some cases. In
general a good modeling possibility that is good to keep in the back
of the mind.

<p>
So understand the <code>yield/next</code> bits above.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The yield statement turns <code>task()</code> into a <i>generator</i>.
</p>

<p>
A generator function is called just like any other function in Python,
but when the <b>yield statement is executed</b>, <b>control is returned to the
caller of the function</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is essentially a <b>context switch</b>, as control moves from the
generator function to the caller.
</p>

<p>
The interesting part is that <b>control can be given back</b> to the
generator function by calling <code>next()</code> <b>on the generator</b>.
</p>

<p>
This is a context switch back to the generator function, which <b>picks
up execution with all function variables</b> that were defined before the
yield still intact.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that this is the big difference with multi-threading. You
are in control and know when the control switch happens.

<div id="outline-container-orgbd9f210" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbd9f210">asyncio</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd9f210">
<p>
This is solid module that enables you to perform single threaded
asynchronous programming.
</p>

<p>
Asynchoronous programming is managed through the event loop. You
have a lot of notes about it in your notes by now.
</p>

<p>
In general I like this explaination a lot. Was a presentation abuot
Javascript asynchronous programming, but this is the general logic
and it helps to fix the concept in your memory.
</p>

<style>
.container {
 position: relative;
 left: 15%;
 margin-top: 60px;
 margin-bottom: 60px;
 width: 70%;
 overflow: hidden;
 padding-top: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */
 display:block;
 overflow-y: hidden;
}

.responsive-iframe {
 position: absolute;
 top: 0;
 left: 0;
 bottom: 0;
 right: 0;
 width: 100%;
 height: 100%;
 border: none;
 display:block;
 overflow-y: hidden;
}
</style>

<div class="container"> 
 <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aGhZQkoFbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen;> </iframe>
</div>

<p>
Then in such a module you have a lot of methods that will start a
task and return to the event loop as long as they are idly waiting
for an event that would allow the task to continue processing.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org120c242" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org120c242">asyncio.http</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org120c242">
<p>
This is a module that allows the possibility of making asynchronous
http requests.
</p>

<p>
Meaning you make a request but you do not block the main thread
until you get an answer.
</p>

<p>
You rather pass the ball to the event loop in such a way and you
just will come back to the request via context switch when the
response arrived.
</p>

<p>
You can see <a href="https://realpython.com/python-async-features/#reader-comments">here</a> a 101 example of working with it vs. synchronous
<i>blocking</i> http requests.
</p>

<p>
Note that the longer your request is the better it is to work
through such framework.
</p>

<p>
The only issue is that even with this asynchoronous component you
do not solve the issue of timeouts. You can see how to tune
client-side timeout in python <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#timeouts">here</a>. Recall that it is a best
practice to attach such timeouts to the requests.
</p>

<p>
For real longer running jobs - it is better to use <b><a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#streaming-requests">http streaming</a></b>
or <b>websockets</b>.
</p>

<p>
Cause I might have longer running jobs and have to see if this
could be a solution or if it is rather better to work with
multi-threading as in the solution I already developed.
</p>

<p>
Explore this more in any case as I am sure that this will be quite
needed in the times to come.
