<p>
Here are some notes about how to set up a project.
</p>

<p>
I will use this strucuture in the following projects I will have to
do.
</p>

<p>
For the last project I set up the project from scratch and I think
that I finally found my way to structure Python Projects in the right
way.
</p>

<p>
Right way - this means - a way that satisfies the following properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is modular. This is extremely important. If you manage to work in
a modular way by clearly separating logical structures you might use
some of these structures for further projects you will work on.</li>

<li>It is portable - by the very same argument explained above.</li>

<li>It is minimal - no double effort</li>

<li>It has strong logic - i.e. it is clear what modules and sub-modules
represent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will go into structure and some examples of how to reach such
components next.
</p>

<p>
Note again that this is my second larger project where starting from a
green field I could set everything up. You might want to change and
expand on this structure in following projects.
</p>

<p>
Please, do so and do not forget to expand on that.

<p>
Starting from the very beginning the general structure for the
project would look as follows. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga6f37f1">
.
├── libraries
├── log
├── Dockerfile
├── postman
├── src
└── test
</pre>

<p>
This general structure is motived by the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>libraries</code>: here you have the libraries you work with for your
project in a text file. like this it will be possible for your
peers or yourself to download all the necessary dependencies when
creating a new virtual environment or pushing to the cloud.</li>

<li><code>log</code>: here is a module that will hold the logged information of
your application. this is especially important for doing properly
devOps. Especially when pushing to the cloud you will have the
possibility to double check at later moments important logged
situations. You can then trigger mail alters based on the type of
the logs etc.</li>

<li><code>postman</code>: here you save all of your endpoints when you test them
together with all the typical payloads etc. It is especially
useful when you define and expand RESTful API such that you can
quickly share them with your team and so that they can test and
try your endpoints. This especially when they work in the
back-end without being exposed through web-interfaces.</li>

<li><code>src</code>: the actual code for the project.</li>

<li><code>test</code>: the actual tests for the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will explore the <code>src</code> repo structure next.
