<p>
This post contains some information around Garbage Collectors.
</p>

<p>
It is important to understand this as this has important consequences
when writing your code.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance about the ORM and how the instances are garbage
collected in JPA.

<p>
So starting with the basic structure of the JVM, the thing looks as
follows:

So it is important that you understand this basics JVM set up.

<h2 id="org694d420">On automatic Garbage Collection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org694d420">
<p>
So understand the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Automatic garbage collection is the process of <b>looking at heap
memory</b>, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and
<b>deleting the unused objects</b>.
</p>

<p>
An <b>in use object</b>, or a referenced object, means that some part of your
program still <b>maintains a pointer to that object</b>.
</p>

<p>
An unused object, or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by
any part of your program. So the <i>memory used by an unreferenced object
can be reclaimed</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the above is essentially the idea.
</p>

<p>
We look next how this process of garbage collection takes ultimately
place.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2d45fe6">
<p>
After the marking the process of deletion takes place.
</p>

<p>
There are essentially two types of deletion:

<p>
Note that this will be more efficient in the new memory
allocation.

<h3 id="orgaf9bdaf">Generational Garbage Collection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaf9bdaf">
<p>
The question here is about the marking component.
</p>

<p>
How are the different pieces of memory marked?
</p>

<p>
Here is the concept of <i>generations</i>. This makes garbage collection
especially handy.
</p>

<p>
The core idea of it is essentially the one that newly instantiated
objects are generally short living.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance at how many times you assign a variable and just
use it in a specific very limited context.
</p>

<p>
In this sense it makes sense to limit the amount of objects
checked in the garbage collection sense depending on the life span
of the object.
</p>

<p>
The idea is backed up by empirical data on the life span of Object
as visible in the following image:

<h4 id="orgdd3c3b0">On the Concept of Generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdd3c3b0">
<p>
This brings directly to the point of generations.
</p>

<p>
Essentially the objects are assigned to different generations in
the memory heap.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-11-15 140823.png" class="center">

<p>
So watch out and read very carefully the above.
</p>

<p>
You should fix the following concepts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>stop the world</b></li>

<li><p>
<b>difference between minor garbage collection and major garbage
collection</b>:
</p>

<p>
this essentially talkes about whether the garbage collection
takes place in the young generation or in the old
generation. Note that major garbage collections are very large
events. In this sense, the responsiveness of the application
would be reduced.
</p>

<p>
So you try to reduce these larger garbage collection processes
checking at the state of the Objects troughout the entire
application. 
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd90a36b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd90a36b">On the Generational Assignment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd90a36b">
<p>
This goes hand in hand with the previous thoughts and explains a
bit the Object allocation in the different spaces.
</p>

<p>
We will check about the process next:
</p>

<p>
Newly created Objects are always assigned to the Eden space. Then
when the Eden space is filled up, the allocated objects are moved
to S0 or S1 - you always start with S0 then you transition among
the two at each <i>minor garbage collection</i> increasing the survivor
age which will determine the ultimate promotion in an older
category group.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-11-15 143822.png" class="center">

<p>
The promotion happens after a given level of maturity is reached.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-11-15 144143.png" class="center">

<p>
Finally eventually the older generation heap space also fills up
and a major garbage collection event is triggered in order to
compact the data and free up disk space.
