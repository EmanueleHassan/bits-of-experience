This post deals with music theory.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 
</p>

<p>
But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.
</p>

<p>
This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 
</p>

<p>
The general idea - in music and life is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026; But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 
</p>

<p>
After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.

<p>
Everything in music can be reduced to intervals (or distances
between notes) and their relationships.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org7d03c58">On Sound</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7d03c58">
<p>
Recall all of the physics is contained in music:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Everything in nature is energy vibrating at different frequencies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So is sound - it is waves travelling through a medium - often
air. A specific sound has a pitch (the wavelength) - measuring the
frequency of the sound - and an amplitude - measuring the strength
of the sound.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-01-22 210323.png" class="center">

<p>
Recall as well that the human being has the capacity of hearing
sound in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. You always move in this
space so to say.
</p>

<p>
A note is then a specific named pitch. Aside from the pitch, notes
have other defining qualities - such as: <b>time duration</b>,
<b>loudness</b> and <b>quality</b>.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it you have the concept of <b>timbre</b>. This is a sound
color that comes from different instruments. For instance, a C
note on a piano is the same as a C note on a violin but we
experience them differently due to the different timbre.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> what we hear as a single note is actually a <i>whole
spectrum</i> of related higher frequencies coming from the
instrument, that our ears perceive, more or less, as a single
frequency. This is part of the reason why different instruments
have different <i>timbres</i>.
</p>

<p>
In a sense, studying harmony and melody boils down to studying
pitch and the relationships between different pitches.
</p>

<p>
The relationships between pitches are called intervals.
</p>

<h3 id="org42662a5">On Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org42662a5">
<p>
There are <b>12</b> notes in Western music.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A, A# or Bb, B, C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, E, F, F# or Gb, G, G#
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As you are learning the piano now - make sure you have the system
well in your mind. 
</p>

<p>
Note as well that there are no sharps or flats between B-C and
E-F. Once you have this well into your mind it will help you to
quickly find your way on the piano and will help you to navigate
the octaves and the different notes positions quickly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Exercise</i>: try to make sense of it at some stage and understand
why it turned out exactly like this.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that the notes without sharps or flats are called
<b>natural notes</b> in western tradition.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind the note circle in this sense. You will have to work
with it - it hides the structure of the tetrahedron that you still
have to figure out.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-01-22 224313.png" class="center">

<p>
Note that when you move clockwise you go higher in pitch. You use
the sharp notation in this case (#). When you move
counterclockwise you go lower in pitch. You use the flat notation
in this case (b).
</p>

<h3 id="org7f54fc9">On Registers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f54fc9">
<p>
Note that in western music you have 12 notes. These cover the
entire spectrum of listenable sound 20 Hz - 20 kHz.
</p>

<p>
In this sense notes are repeated in <b>higher and lower registers</b>.
You are very familiar with the concept simply by checking at a
piano.
</p>

<p>
Note that the distance between two notes in adjacents registers is
<b>an octave</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note that two notes distanced by an octave have the property that
taking a starting and ending point the amount of waves halves /
doubles exactly.

<p>
Q: what is the definition of note then? Check at the image on
page 25. There are some places where the waves reach the same
level. But this one I guess with any note.
</p>

<p>
So it must be something about the major ratios. You have to
think more in these schema.
