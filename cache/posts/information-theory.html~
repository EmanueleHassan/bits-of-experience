<p>
So I will start to collect a bit of random thoughts about information
theory.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I regret not having properly studied it at Univeristy
time. I remember that I wanted to check at it at some point. I was
especially interested in theory about wavlets and fourier transform.
</p>

<p>
Now that I got more interested in it as I think that by approaching
scientifically the noise that is out there you might be able to reduce
the noise and properly intercept the messages.

<p>
So this is quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
The basis is in this paper:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of
uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy
channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude
Shannon in a paper entitled <code>A Mathematical Theory of Communication</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the essential idea is the following:
</p>

<p>
Information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the
goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have
the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error,
in spite of the channel noise.
</p>

<p>
So note that if somebody wants to convey messages across a channel
it will most likely respect this basic theory.
</p>

<p>
Now there is as well a major result:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem showed that,
in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is
asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity
dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the
messages are sent.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So there are now a couple of questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>What are these statistics?</i></li>

<li><p>
<i>Think about the internet. How did it affected these statistics</i>.
</p>

<p>
The channel is getting brighter. But if the information is the
same how do you keep the message alive and keep tranmitting it
<i>with a low frequency of error</i>? Do you increase the repetitions
of the message?
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Think about these questions. They are quite interesting.

<p>
It goes little in the details of the formulas and you cannot really
understand much from it.
