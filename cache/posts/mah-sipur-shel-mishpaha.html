<p>
So this is an important post to me. 
</p>

<p>
It is important as I will put in here some very deep thoughts about
myself as a person. 
</p>

<p>
The thing is that I am starting to create some more personal posts, as
I see that blogging is a very nice thing and to limit it just to some
work-related thing would be an error. 
</p>

<p>
I want this blog to be part of my legacy. I want this blog to
ultimately represent myself as a whole. I want it to be a picture of
myself in time. 
</p>

<p>
I want my children to come here in decades and understand my story and
their story. This also because I think that the history of my family,
like most of the Jewish families stories, is very tragic and rich and
it was a pity for me to discover it just slowly in time. It delayed my
understanding of my <i>shorashim</i> and it cost me precious time to shape
myself in a given direction from a very tender age, when everything is
much easier. 
</p>

<p>
To know and understand your story is important. Life is hard and
complex. It is hard and sometimes its meaning is not straightforward
and it is then easy to loose direction, to forget about higher
life-goals and ultimately end up living a void life. The same void
life that brings then young people without a purpose to start drinking
and making use of drugs, to people commit suicide, fight with each
other etc. etc. 
</p>

<p>
So let's come to the meat of the post&#x2026;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org28e6c19" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org28e6c19">Mah sipur shel hamishpaha - on the father side?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28e6c19">
<p>
Well let's say that I did not understand the story of my family when
I was young. 
</p>

<p>
I remember that I was confused when seeing that part of my
family. They were complex, weird, different. 
</p>

<p>
Now, after some time, when growing up, getting to know their story,
their legacy, their culture, now I understand things better. I
understand that their character and behavior was dictated by their
legacy and by their story of sorrow. 
</p>

<p>
So in order to understand that piece of history, understand this:
the story of your family is essential the one of the Jewish community
of Libya:

<br>
<br>

<p>
And in order to understand it even better watch the following
</p>

<br>
<br>

<div class="container">
 <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3H6cM1_2Bw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen;> </iframe>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<p>
Now understand that your family was one of the families that stayed
in Libya until the very end, until the 1967 and the pogroms that
happened following the six day war in Israel.
</p>

<p>
Understand that your family was among the 5k Jews that stayed until
the end due to economic interests as mentioned in the documentary
above. I discovered in time that your family was among the most
wealthy in the country. They apparently had a very large commercial
business and had a lot of real estate there.
</p>

<p>
With 1967 they lost it all. They lived the pogrom, were locked down
for days with the fear of being killed. Later they eventually managed
to come to Italy thanks to the help of the Italian government. They
arrived with 20 dollars and 20 kg of personal effects as all of the
other 5000 Jewish people that left Libya in 1967. 
</p>

<p>
They were then among the 2000 Jews that stayed in Italy after their
arrival. They settled down in Milan. This was possible for them cause in
comparison to many other families, their wealthy business of the
time had a smaller business unit in Italy and some part of the
larger Hassan family was taking care of
it. They helped the rest of the family - including my father,
uncles and grandparents - to settle down in Italy.
</p>

<p>
I think that my father's family never fully recovered. At least I
am sure as far as my grand-parents are concerned. This is why they
were weird and it was strange to go to see them. This is why they
were different and I never liked too much spending time there when
I was a child. I was just doing it because I understood that my
father did care about it. 
</p>

<p>
I think that as well said in the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3H6cM1_2Bw&amp;t=838s">this moment</a> the real
issue with their recovery was not the wealth loss but rather the
identity loss. I think that for my grand-father it was a huge loss,
from being an entrepreneur and on the head of a big business to
have nothing to do in his time. And the cultural shock was huge for
him as well: the complete different culture - I recall that
the culture of my family, and you still see it my father and my
character at times, was very much Arab.
</p>

<p>
But the loss was not just limited to the grand-parents. It affected
their children as well. My oldest uncle, that was around 20 when
the pogrom of 1967 happened never fully managed to reboot his
life. He never managed to start from scratch with the studies, the
work and to construct a family in Italy. 
</p>

<p>
The other two did manage. It was easier for them; my father was 10
when the pogrom happened. Not without sorrow. My father once
confessed me that he eventually became entrepreneur and started his
own business in his early 20s in order to give again some
entrepreneurial light to his father, which he saw highly suffering
after settling down in Italy. 
</p>

<p>
It is also incredible the connection with that bit of past from my father.
This despite of the fact that he moved to Italy with 10. I still recall when he was
diagnosed cancer how we used to spend afternoons watching videos of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5QS0Oa6zBbknPbHA8GRd8Q">Hamos Guetta</a> youtube channel. I mean I moved to Switzerland with
17 and I do not feel such a strong connection with Italy in this
sense. But somehow surprisingly I do with Israel and that small
number of Libya Jewish people. 
</p>

<p>
That is interesting as I was raised up in a mixed family with
secular traditions and liberal mindset. But this I guess is the curse of every
person where the Jewish blood flows. You do not cancel such past
and struggles and with time when you understand the relativity of
the world it grows in you.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, I do not know how it will proceed with me. I would
like to preserve such roots in time. But everyone that knows a
little bit the Jewish communities knows that it is not as easy for
a person that grew up outside of a strict Jewish education as
me. There is risk that such history will get lost in time. I am in
a personal struggle which is not easy to solve. 
</p>

<p>
I am paying my dues by further educating myself, growing my
understanding of the Israeli story, understanding how everything
came about, educating myself about what it means to be Jew,
learning Jewish history, learning Hebrew. But will it be enough?
Who knows&#x2026; we will see. 
</p>

<p>
In any case whatever the <i>sipur</i> of my family will be in time,
know this part of it. Know what your family has been
through. Know that we once lost it all and we managed to slowly
reconstruct ourselves. Know the suffering, inform yourself and
educate yourself to the Jewish tradition and history as it is a rich
one and it enriches the spirit of the individual as well. 
</p>

<p>
This especially if growing up in the EU society which is
traditionally anti-Israeli. Never feel ashamed of your roots. Too
long I was probably fearing some judgment of the people due to my
lack of understanding of the things. 
</p>

<p>
Read and understand Jewish and Israeli history and you will start
to understand what Israel is and don't ever let yourself be
intimidated by your peers with little or no knowledge of Israel and
its history. With little understanding of what Israel is and what
it represent to Jewish people and families as mine that lost it all
due to their religion. With little understanding of the
difficulties of keeping a fragile nation alive. 
</p>

<p>
Watch/read in this sense:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exodus; Paul Newman</li>

<li>the classics of Holocaust</li>

<li>Letters of Jonathan Netanyahu</li>

<li>Israel - the history of a nation reborn</li>

<li>understand aliyah and its idea</li>
