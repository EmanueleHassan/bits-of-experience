<p>
So it is slowly becoming clear that golden numbers are the core.
</p>

<p>
Geometry is important and you should understand better these.
</p>

<p>
They carry most of the information that is around in the world. They
are very powerful numbers.
</p>

<p>
Understand them, understand well the golden mean spiral, fibonacci and
binary and you will have a profound understanding of the things.

<p>
This one is very core. It is everywhere in architecture and
nature. 
</p>

<p>
People recognize it at subconscious level. Some might even make the
thing explicit. But you should be careful with it. Many bad things
in history happened because of this.

<h2 id="orge4945b4">On Pi</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4945b4">
<p>
Pi is the constant used to calculate the circumfernece and the area
of circle.
</p>

<p>
Circle that important geometrical shape, which properties we can
but approximate through this beautiful irrational number.
</p>

<p>
Isn't life funny?
</p>

<p>
One of the core geometrical shapes and we can but approximate. So
fascinating this world. 
</p>

<p>
Well it turns out that a lot of people wrap their head around this
question. 
</p>

<p>
The question of it is how many times does a square represented by
the radius of the circle fit within the circle.
</p>

<p>
One way to compute the area of the circle and therefore
approximating this constant was from Archimedes. He basically used
the bisection method. 
</p>

<p>
He created polygonos around the circle which area he could
compute with standard results. He then created polygonos within the
circle. He could again compute the area with standard tools. He
could then infer the boundaries of the pi constant. 
</p>

<p>
Think about the Metraton cube in this sense. There all of the
polygonos are potentially embedded in a sphere/circle. Is there any
link among the two?
</p>

<p>
The question is now: how is Pi nowadays computed? How many numbers
did they estimate? Is the approach similar to the one of Archimedes?
</p>

So this is a number that represents the following limit.

It is easy to see in this sense why it is so widely used in
finance and especially in the limit case of continuous time.
