<p>
So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
</p>

<p>
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
</p>

<p>
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
</p>

<p>
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
</p>

<p>
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update as of 26/04/2022</i> The above argumentation is correct but I
understand right now that the notes in this section are not based on
a risk model internally developed within the insurance
company. Rather, these are simple factor model representations of the
fixed income space used by the risk provider the company buys most of
the solution from.
</p>

<p>
Considering the fact that most of the risk providers copy each other I
suspect that these are in fact the very standard way of implementing
these models.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution">following entry</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="org906586b">On fixed income attribution models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org906586b">
<p>
So what these models do is to decompose the risk of fixed-income
instruments in different components. You would then price the
different components and ultimately aggregate the risk of them.
</p>

<h3 id="orgf1eddb9">Interest Rate Risk</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1eddb9">
<p>
So I will start in this post with the interest rate risk. I will
then check at other risk-factors as I go along. 
</p>

<p>
So the yield-curve and interest rate risk is just one among the many
factors. However, this is an important one.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you use your standard duration models you can perform
analysis of the risks for the case of parallel movements of the
yield-curve.
</p>

<p>
What happens though in the case of other more non-linear
movements? There you have to think in terms of different models
that can capture such shifts.
</p>

<p>
This is the reason why you can use factor-based models for the
interest reate curve that capture such non-linearities.
</p>

<p>
A typical decomposition in this sense is the:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>shift</li>

<li>twist</li>

<li>butterfly</li>
</ul>

<p>
decomposition.
</p>

<img src="../../images/yield-curve_glossary.jpg" class="center">

<p>
So note that the butterfly acts more on the curvature of the yield
curve hitting in multiple points.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the twist is more acting on the first-order level
changing the steepness of the yield curve but holding the general
curvature structure. Note that by definition changing the twist
will affect the curvature, and having a butterfly will affect the
steepness of the curve. The two are therefore not completely
isolated. Would be fun at some point to read more into the
mathematical relation of the two but as having enough things on
your plate this is jumped at the moment - and likely forever. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have a factor model for the yield-curve taking into
account the three elements and mapping the influence of each on the
yield curve you can start to make all of your scenario based on
it.
</p>

<p>
The simple idea as in the Nelson-Siegel model is the following:
</p>

<p>
-&gt; you have your observable yield curve and the given interest
rates at different maturities composing the curve.
</p>

<p>
-&gt; you have a function composed of constants terms (measuring
shifts), first order terms (measuring twist) and more complex terms
(measuring butterfly).
</p>

<p>
You then parameterize the influence of each term in order to get
the best possible representation of the <b>current</b> yield curve
(standard OLS / minimization exercise).
</p>

<p>
This is done in the following way:
</p>

<p>
Let's say that you want to estimate parametrically the yield curve
for a specific yield curve.
</p>

<p>
Then what you actually do is take the bonds for the given country -
the country of which you want to represent the yield to
maturity. Then you know that the price is a function of the yield
to maturity. And you know that the yield to maturity is a function
of your interest rate factor representation.
</p>

<p>
So basically you do your minimization exercise by fitting the
prices of the bonds. This should give you a large enough sample for
your estiamation. You will then end up with a factor representation
of the yield curve and therefore of the interest rate curve.
</p>

<p>
Once you found your parameteric representation of the yield curve
depending on that factors you can make your standard sensitivities
analysis by standard math-analysis arguments.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you can generate the simulations for the different terms
tweaking your yield curve. Based on the simulation of these few
terms you are actually generating possible simulations of the yield
curve. This because what you actually have is a model for the
entire yield curve based on the simple shift-twist-butterfly
terms. Given the parameterization of the effect of each you then
have a new simulated state for your yield curve that you can use to
price your fixed interest rate instruments.    
</p>

<p>
<b>Important side note:</b> Note that the above is a simplified
explaination of the model. In the models you actually have two kind
of parameters. Paramters defining the influence of each shape term
on the yield curve and decay factor parameters defining the
location of the "humps" of the butterfly terms. But the main idea
stays and you can easily understand how it works even with these
terms. 
</p>

<p>
So this is a little bit the logic you reason with in the market
risk model for capturing the interest rate risk.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Important note:</b>
</p>

<p>
Note that the risk lies in the paramters/loadings of the shift,
twist and butterfly terms and not in the factor themself.
</p>

<p>
This is evident when looking at the model, the factors are fixed
and are terms expressing the time decay. The parameters are
estimated.
</p>

<p>
The essential idea is then
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This implies an alternative interpretation of the parameters, or more
specifically the parameters (β0, β1, β2), as a set of stochastic risk
factors whose variation from period to period (i.e., return) drives
the evolution of the yield curve.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Add on the top of it the assumption that the parameters over t →
t + 1 are distributed approximately symmetrically around zero and
you will have your interest rate risk model.  (I guess even
normally-distributed as what I could infer as per the discussions
with my peers here - this is not that important to this stage. You
will discover in time. Focus on the big picture in the meantime).
</p>

<p>
Note now that the factors - risk factors - driving the yields are
not the parameters themselves but the parameters change in time. 
</p>

<p>
This can be formally prove through Ito's lemma. You can show in a
more rigorous way that the change in the yield curve at any point
in time is driven by the change of the risk factors in calendar
time. So you see that the factors are ultimately the difference
among the paramters and these are risk and symmetrically
distributed. Check the papers you are reading in this sense.
</p>

<p>
Similar formal arguments can be applied to the bond prices such
that you would ultimately end up with a factor level representation
of the bond returns. And badaboom, you have your factor risk model
through which you can simulate the returns.
</p>

<p>
You can then see that the factors are estimated via least squares.
</p>

<p>
So note that the above is all correct but it is a bit confusing as
it does not draw the proper line between the two estimation
exercises you want to do:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Estimate the parameters modeling the yield curve</li>

<li>Estimate the factors (the delta of the parameters in time). This
are the ultimate factors relevant for the simulation of the bond
returns.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can check the relevant document that you have if you want to
get the details.
</p>

<p>
This will be good nonetheless. It is mostly focused on the
understanding of the model in an unstructured way. By know you have
that understanding and this is what counts.
