So I quickly took time to fix the Python issue. I could first download
just the portable version of it due to security issues.
</p>

<p>
But then it was just a pain to configure pip and to get all of the
proper configuration to work with virtualenvironments.
</p>

<p>
I also did not want to live like a moroon and not work with virtual
environments knowing that it will come to hit me back at some
point. Plus when the transition to the cloud will be completed and a
more solid microservices approach will be in place it will be
essential to have virtual environments for having all of the needed
dependencies for each project and just load these into your docker
image/container.
</p>

<p>
The same holds for these very heavy and ugly solutions such as conda
and friends.

<p>
So not having set up the entire environment in proper way from the
beginning due to the security issues already resolved in a
fragmented environment on my machine.
</p>

<p>
There are already things set up at the global level (for instance
nikola) and I do not want to take the time now to refactor
everything.
</p>

<p>
So my decision is to take such global config at face value and do
not touch it anymore and do all of my python stuff that is gonna
come in virutal environemnts.
</p>

<p>
Note that due to the fragmented environment you should always use
the following:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org6ca1c38">
python.exe
</pre>

<p>
for performing your python operations. You have other python
executables on your path but they shall not be used.
</p>

<p>
Given that this is your solid config, you can now build virtual env
out of it via
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org3527dd0">
python.exe -m venv &lt;MY_VENV&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that you can then activate the virutalenv from a windows DOS
via
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge1477cb">
&lt;MY_VENV&gt;/Scripts/activate
</pre>

<p>
Do that via a DOS and not via eshell as at the moment that is not
recognizing the virtual env and then you can start to make mess in
there if you start to download stuff in the global config by
errror.
</p>

<p>
So just do that and stay on the safe side, or check at the eshell
and code it to recognize the stuff.
</p>

<p>
You can then activate your virtual-environments for elpy through the
virtualenvwrapper emacs module and work through the IDE as you did
most of your time at IBM.
