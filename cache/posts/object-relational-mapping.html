<p>
So basically the idea of object relational mapping is the one of
mapping relational tables to objects.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that a lot of times the application logic is in objects
while the persistency layer is in the relational schema.
</p>

<p>
That translation is annoying and time consuming. Plus it requires a
mind switch to think at the two different levels.
</p>

<p>
The idea of this technology was essentially to develop a framework to
map the relational persistency layer to the ORM paradigm. In such a
way it is possible for the developer to wire his mind into a single
setting - the one of the objects and to properly develop in a pure
object oriented mind.
</p>

<p>
In this sense this is a lot what is happening in the NoSQL space,
especially with the document store and the json communication format
for API.. the underlying driver must is the same&#x2026;. avoid all of that
annoying conversions from one paradigm to the other.
</p>

<p>
So you see; always think in terms of drivers&#x2026; you will anticipate
the future once you focus on the underlying driver and force instead
of on the concept itself.

In general much of these notes refer to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbwuWh_eH4AhVDwQIHHW0vC9sQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoclaptrinhdanang.com%2Fdownloads%2Fpdf%2Fspring%2FJava%2520Persistence%2520with%2520Hibernate.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0524Xl7sPIrS85z5EARMyP">following book</a>.

<h2 id="orgcd0ff21">Important Concepts leading to ORM</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd0ff21">
<p>
So this is very important.
</p>

<p>
It must sit in a very important way in your brain.
</p>

<p>
Cause this topic is very hot in the team and it is at least good
that you have an understanding of going into one direction or the
other.
</p>

<p>
So interesting to see is that much of the topics discussed that
follow come from thinking in terms of objects and the respective
shortcoming when going 
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgcfa5ac6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcfa5ac6">Problem of Granularity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcfa5ac6">
<p>
The idea is that in the OOP world you have lots of level of
granularity through which you can create and shape your objects.
</p>

<p>
These are very important as through them you can create very
sophisticated business logic.
</p>

<p>
Now when working with SQL the point is essentially that such
<i>level of granularity is lost</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is generally not a big practice to work with <code>user-defined data
    types</code> in SQL relational DBs. You generally work at two level of
granularity - tables and columns with the SQL standard data
types. 
</p>

<p>
The key now is essentially the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Many simple persistence mechanisms fail to recognize this mismatch and
so end up forcing the less flexible representation of SQL products on
the object-oriented model, effectively flattening it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="orgd15528f"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> the book claims for a solution to the above problem - find it and integrate it here then.</h4>

<div id="outline-container-org89ab90e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org89ab90e">The problem of Subtypes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89ab90e">
<p>
Essentially this is the problem of inheritance and polymorphism
and the fact that there is no way to really express this into a
relational database.
</p>

<p>
This makes everything quite tricky.
</p>

<p>
Essentially it is the following:

<div id="outline-container-org7bcf934" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7bcf934">The problem of Identity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bcf934">
<p>
That is also quite an interesting one.
</p>

<p>
The idea is of a radical difference among the identity principles
in Java and the application side and on the relational DBs.
</p>

<p>
The concept is that in Java you have two different concepts of
identity:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>== -&gt; checking by reference</li>

<li>.equals () -&gt; checking by value</li>
</ul>

<p>
While on the DB side you have the idea of checking by primary
key for checking the uniqueness of a record.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, understand as well the following concept that is
related to the concept of identity:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-07-06 090604.png" class="center">

<p>
Note that this is very likely related to the idea of not setting
any <code>setters</code> for the primary key columns in Hibernate. This is
the same underlying idea.
</p>

<p>
This is also why you also have an ID for the different tables and
use ultimately that one. It is the way to implement that concept
of <i>surrogate key</i> and this is why Sergio was so focused on it in
his introduction. I did not really get it properly to that stage. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1015508" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1015508">The problem of association</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1015508">
<p>
Object-oriented languages represent associations using object
references; but in the relational world, a <i>foreign key</i> â€“constrained
column represents an association, with copies of key values.
</p>

<p>
The constraint is a rule that guarantees integrity of the
association.  There are <i>substantial differences</i> between the two
mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
Object references are <i>directional</i>. Navigation in a particular
direction has no meaning for a relational data model because you
can create arbitrary data associations with join and projection
operators.
</p>

<p>
The important thing is <b>the following</b> then:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The challenge is to map a completely open data model, which is
independent of the application that works with the data, to an
application-dependent navigational model.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orge02e007" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge02e007">The problem of data navigation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge02e007">
<p>
So basically when working with ORM it is important to keep the
thing under control by not overloading the system with very
expensive queries fetching all of the possible data relations
across the object network in the mapped DB world.
</p>

<p>
The idea is the one of leveraging <i>lazy loading</i> as a solution as
discussed a couple of times:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Any object persistence solution worth its salt provides
functionality for fetching the data of associated instances only
when the association is first accessed in Java code.  This is
known as lazy loading: retrieving data on demand only.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that this is not a trivial problem. Cause on the other side
you have the following problem:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This piecemeal style of data access is fundamentally inefficient [the
one of lazy loading] in the context of an SQL database, because it
requires executing one statement for each node or collection of the
object network that is accessed. This is the dreaded n+1 selects
problem - i.e. you actually perform too many queries killing the DB.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So essentially you have the difficult problem:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>avoid the <b>cartesian product</b> vs.  avoid <b>n+1 select</b> problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not trivial to solve and decide at development time.
