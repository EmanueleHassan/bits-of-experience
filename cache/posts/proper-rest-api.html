<p>
So starting to dig a little bit deeper into the way to properly write
your APIs.
</p>

<p>
After the OpenAPI specifications and the integration with Swagger,
there is the component of hypermedia.
</p>

<p>
I like this added layer as it will allow you to very solidly program
your APIs and produce and consume them in a very programmatic way.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
In order to understand that component understand properly the three
layers of the maturity level everyone talks about.
</p>

<p>
You can check as well this project in planning mode - <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypermedia/">here</a>. Cool
project, it is in fact something missing in the python dev space.

<p>
Check at the following three layers for producing and consuming
APIs.
</p>

<p>
Check at the following urls in order to understand it and
understand where you are staying and the way you want to develop:

<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">source 2</a> - essentially copy of first source</li>

<li><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">source 3</a> - the real document posing a solid reference for
web-based architectures and a must read in order to properly
understand the logic.</li>

So basically in spring you have an entire <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/#client.traverson">hateoas suite</a>.
</p>

<p>
In python you can start checking at <a href="https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">marshmallow</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am starting to make some experiments in  <a href="https://github.com/MarcoHassan/mySpringPlayground">my helloworld example</a>.
</p>

<p>
Still really in 101 phase. Will slowly progress in time as a side job.
