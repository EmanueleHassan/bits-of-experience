The basic idea of Docker is to allow the possibility to save all of
the configuration of an application in one single image. This should
be considered as a safe environment that once properly set up can be
easily shared among different teams and once images are instantiated
all of the different teams can be sure to operate and leverage the
right configuration for running their application.
</p>

<p>
A simple and straight forward overview about the advantage of Docker
might be found in this sense at <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker_architecture.htm">docker architecture</a>.
</p>

<p>
To sum up before starting the basic idea is to create images and to
create containers based on that, which will run then the application
as defined in the docker image.

<p>
With virtual machine you leverage hypervisors that runs virtual
machines. It is what virtualizes resources and makes them sharable.
Up on the virtualized resources you build then your different OS and
specify all of the middleware necessary to run your application.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to <i>virtual machines</i> that with docker, u have a single
host OS. Notice moreover that docker does not require the entire Linux
OS but rather simply its kernel. Important is moreover to notice that
all the containers share the linux kernel here.
</p>

<p>
Docker tries to share resources. This means that if a layer is already
running for an application a second application will leverage the
instance of this exact lower layer and will ultimately save resources.

<h3 id="orgb31bc56">Basic commands</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb31bc56">
<p>
Writing a Dockerfile is the first step to containerizing an
application. You can think of these Dockerfile commands as a
step-by-step recipe on how to build up our image. This one takes the
following steps:
</p>

<pre class="example">
## Example of a Dockerfile

FROM node:6.11.5    

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install    
COPY . .

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]  

</pre>

<p>
Notice;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>FROM</code> start the pre-existing docker image <code>node:6.11.5</code>. This was
cloned from the git repo used in the tutorial. It gives a grasp on
the layered structure of docker, where you can start in the lower
layer with basic images and run on top of them new images leveraging
the basic ones.</li>

<li><code>WORKDIR</code> specifies that all the subsequent actions should be taken
from the directory <code>/usr/src/app/</code> in your <b>image filesystem</b>.</li>

<li><code>COPY</code> the file <code>package.json</code> from your docker host to the present
location <code>.</code> such that it is available in the image and the
deployment can leverage it. Notice that the files passed with the
<code>COPY</code> command will be used by the <code>$ docker build</code> command to
create an image. To increase the build’s performance, exclude files
and directories by adding a <code>.dockerignore</code>.</li>

<li><code>RUN</code> the command <code>npm install</code> inside your <b>image filesystem</b>.</li>

<li><code>COPY</code> the rest of your app's source code from your host to your
image filesystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can see that <i>these are much the same steps you might have taken to
set up and install your app on your host</i> - but capturing these as a
Dockerfile allows us to do the same thing inside a portable, isolated
Docker image.
</p>

<p>
The final line with the <code>CMD</code> directive is the docker specific way of
specifying some metadata in our image that describes how to run a
container based off of the specified image.
</p>

<p>
In this case, it’s saying that the containerized process that this
image is meant to support is <code>npm start</code>.
</p>


<p>
<i>Below a short list of commands. This is however just a way to write them down one time and start to memorize it. A convenient approach when looking forward to do smth is to leverage <code>docker --help</code> and search for the keyword of interest. You can then further inspect with <code>docker &lt;command&gt; --help</code>.</i>
