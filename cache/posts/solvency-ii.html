So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.
</p>

<p>
This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.

<h2 id="org7cafc1c">Technical Provisions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7cafc1c">
<p>
Technical provisions represent the amount that the insurance company
would have to pay in order to transfer its obligations immediately
to another insurance company.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 173239.png" class="center">


<p>
Solvency II requires that technical provisions be calculated as the
sum of the best estimate of the liability and a risk margin to cover
the cost of the capital another insurer would need to hold to take on
the liability.
</p>

<p>
So you see the first bridge. The concept of risk margin is the
pillar of both methodologies, when transferring claims to other
insurances in case of stress.
