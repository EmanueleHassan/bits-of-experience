<p>
So here are some notes on concepts you have to use when working in a
proper OOP way.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, I had written some notes about major OOP
concepts. Unfortunately it got lost. Learn your lesson from it as this
is a real pity.
</p>

<p>
In any case start anew here. Basically this should cover a little bit
of Software Design best practices. Add some notes for instance through
the following sources
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns">design-patterns and refactoring</a> - online source.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf">desing patterns</a> - apparently <i>THE BOOK</i> in order to write proper
software .</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org93caf53">
<p>
So taking now a moment to dig into design patterns.
</p>

<p>
Basically understand that they are broadly defined in to 3
categories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Creational patterns</code>: provide object creation mechanisms that
increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</li>

<li><code>Structural patterns</code>: explain how to assemble objects and classes
into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and
efficient.</li>

<li><code>Behavioral patterns</code>: take care of effective communication and
the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At the end you will see that many things you already started to use
out of the box after a couple of month working more in an OOP way.

<h3 id="orgd13c4cc">Factory Methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd13c4cc">
<p>
Basically this is the one I was already noting when making some
notes generally about Java.
</p>

<p>
This is very core in order to write a bit of solid code. You have to
understand and interiorize it.
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class
defer instantiation to subclasses.</li>

<li>So that is basically a <i>virtual</i> constructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the idea is essentailly the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-01-28 122956.png" class="center">

<p>
This was essentially the note that you made when writing your notes
about java.
</p>

<p>
See now how everything fits in this factory methods picture and good
to have it here in order to have a minimum order and reference it in
a faster way.
</p>

<p>
You see see in this sense how you start to extract important info
from that file and refactor them.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org714cfb2"></a>On reference variables using interafaces&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="tag"><span class="reference_variable">reference_variable</span></span><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org714cfb2">
<p>
This is convenient. Recall that it was possible to define
reference variables as superclasses and to reference then objects
of subclasses. It was then possible to call the different abstract
methods of the superclass that would then trigger the right call
to the actual implementation of it in the subclass.
</p>

<p>
In a similar way it is possible to create reference variables as
interfaces and point then to the different objects of classes
implementing such interface.
</p>

<p>
<b>Any instance of any class that implements the declared interface
can be referred to by such a variable</b>.
</p>

<p>
The exact way the interface is implemented depends then on the
type of object that the reference interface variable points
at. This in a very similar way to what was already explained for
the case of superclass reference variable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> interestingly when you implement a reference variable of
type interface and then refer to an object of some class referring
to that interface you can access all of the methods specified by
the interface via the reference variable but <b>you cannot access
any other members defined in the class</b> implementing the
interface.
</p>

<p>
The method to be executed is looked up dynamically at run time,
allowing classes to be created later than the code which calls
methods on them.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CAUTION Because dynamic lookup of a method at run time incurs a
significant overhead when compared with the normal method invocation
in Java, you should be careful not to use interfaces casually in
performance-critical code.
</p>

<li><a id="org333e73a"></a>On a side note in debugging<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org333e73a">
<p>
So basically I am working quite a bit on some legacy code. You
should be careful about such factory methods as when you have for
instance interfaces which are implemented by similar but
different objects - possibly in a hierarchical way -, say for
instance <code>AbstractFeed</code> and <code>AbstractQuarterly</code>  (implementing
Abstractfeed) and overwriting some methods, well then you see
that it is easy to get confused.
</p>

<p>
You will notice that factory structure by debugging the thing.

<h3 id="org13558ee">Abstract Factory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org13558ee">
<p>
This is also trivial.
</p>

<p>
It is simply a interface that must be implemented by the lower
level classes.
</p>

<p>
Like this you force the implementation of the methods of the
interface and gurantee consistency.

<h3 id="orgdb90586">Callback Methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdb90586">
<p>
So the basic idea is to create an interface with the methods that
the callback will leverage.
</p>

<p>
Then basically depedning on the object that will implement that
intereface you will fallback to different implementations of it.

</pre></div>

<p>
Note that in your code - for instance in the case of the zipParser
you use this concept coupled with the one of functional
programming.
</p>

<p>
I.e. your callback interface is implemented directly via functional
programming and it is never explicitely written anywehere.

<div id="outline-container-org88a18fe" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org88a18fe">Anonymous Inner Classes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88a18fe">
<p>
This is something quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
Anonymous classes are <i>inner classes with no name</i>.
</p>

<p>
Since they have no name, we can't use them in order to create
instances of anonymous classes.
</p>

<p>
As a result, we have to <b>declare and instantiate anonymous classes in
a single expression at the point of use</b>. -&gt; so essentially this is
ultimately the idea.
</p>

<p>
The way you declare this anonymous inner class with no name is the
following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
new ParentClass (&#x2026;) {}
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ParentClass the class you want to create the inner class in</li>

<li>(&#x2026;) here you have to pass the constructor arguments. Note that
this is <i>necessary</i> as you are creating a new object out of the
box.</li>

<li>{} here you have the methods your anonymous class should implement</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Example
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="c1">// Anonymous class - no name.</span>
   <span class="c1">// It basically is an inner class of the parentclass: Book</span>
   <span class="n">myNewObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Book</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Design Patterns&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// constructors arguments of parent class</span>
   <span class="p">{</span>
       <span class="nd">@Override</span>
       <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">description</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>   <span class="c1">// inner class with this method</span>
	   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;Famous GoF book.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
       <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that this is essentially it. The question is then why it is an
<i>inner</i> class? Not that clear to me at this stage. I think that the
naming is a bit confusing.
</p>

<p>
Check at the following minor test that I did. You can in fact as
well access the methods of the parent class. So it looks to me
simply as an extended class object. So don't know keep it as an open
question and do not spend too much time on it now&#x2026; too many things
to learn.

<p>
<b>Finally note</b>: that it is very common as well to use the <i>abstract
inner class</i> patterns as well for interfaces. You can use this as
well there.

<h3 id="org23eb5f1">Polymorphism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23eb5f1">
<p>
Overridden methods are another way that Java implements the “one
interface, multiple methods” aspect of polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
Part of the key to successfully applying polymorphism is understanding
that the superclasses and subclasses form a hierarchy which moves from
lesser to greater specialization.  Used correctly, the superclass
provides all elements that a subclass can use directly. It also
defines those methods that the derived class must implement on its
own. This allows the subclass the flexibility to define its own
methods, yet still enforces a consistent interface.
