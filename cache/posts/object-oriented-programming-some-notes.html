<p>
So here are some notes on concepts you have to use when working in a
proper OOP way.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, I had written some notes about major OOP
concepts. Unfortunately it got lost. Learn your lesson from it as this
is a real pity.
</p>

<p>
In any case start anew here. Basically this should cover a little bit
of Software Design best practices. Add some notes for instance through
the following sources
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns">design-patterns and refactoring</a> - online source.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf">desing patterns</a> - apparently <i>THE BOOK</i> in order to write proper
software .</li>
</ul>

<p>
So when you read the book it is immediate that the design patterns
ultimately depend on the OOP concepts, such as composition,
inheritance, delegation etc. So basically these are the atoms of OOP
and patterns are based on such atoms. So in the book you start from
the atoms. Otherwise it makes sense to read a separate book completely
dedicated to it, such as: <i>Object-Oriented Thought Process</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is a good investement learning such patterns. You will be then much
better able to decompose the existing applications. This will help you
to navigate big existing legacy applications where no description of
it is attached to it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb65c8e1">
<p>
So taking now a moment to dig into design patterns.
</p>

<p>
Basically understand that they are broadly defined in to 3
categories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Creational patterns</code>: provide object creation mechanisms that
increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</li>

<li><code>Structural patterns</code>: explain how to assemble objects and classes
into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and
efficient.</li>

<li><code>Behavioral patterns</code>: take care of effective communication and
the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At the end you will see that many things you already started to use
out of the box after a couple of month working more in an OOP way.

<p>
Generally keep in mind the following overview:

<p>
Note that above <b>object patterns</b> refer to object relationships that
can be changed at <b>run-time</b>. In contrast <b>classes patterns</b> refer
to reletionships among classes, meaning these are static and fixed
at <b>compile time</b>.

<h3 id="org92a3317">Relation Among the Patterns</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92a3317">
<p>
Important is as well to understand that there is a relation among
patterns. I.e. it is quite common to combine them in order to
perform the necessary logic of your programs.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-25 090514.png" class="center">

<p>
Note that some patterns are as well subsititute; think for instance
of <i>prototype</i> and <i>abstract factory</i>.

<p>
So you can refer as well to the following for designing the thing.
</p>

<p>
It will be useful as well, especially at the beginning, for
understanding what patterns you want to apply when creating your
code - less so for reverse engineering existing code - I might be
wrong here though.

p. 24-25.

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Design patterns: Abstract Factory (87),Factory Method
(107),Prototype (117).
</p>

<p>
Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly. Specifying a
class name when you create an object commits you to a particular
implementation instead of a particular interface. This commitment
can complicate future changes. <b>To avoid it, create objects
indirectly</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: Chain of Responsibility (223),Command (233).
</p>

<p>
Dependence on specific operations. When you specify a particular
operation, you commit to one way of satisfying a request. By
<b>avoiding hard-coded requests</b>, you make it easier to change the way
a request gets satisfied both at compile-time and at run-time.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: Abstract Factory(87),Bridge (151).
</p>

<p>
Dependence on hardware and software platform. External operating
system interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) are
different on different hardware and software platforms.Software
that depends on a particular platform will be harder to port to
other platforms.It may even be difficult to keep it up to date on
its native platform. It's important therefore to <b>design your system
to limit its platform dependencies</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: AbstractFactory (87),Bridge (151), Memento (283),Proxy (207).
</p>

<p>
Dependence on object representations or implementations. Clients
that know how an object is represented, stored, located, or
implemented might need to be changed when the object
changes. <b>Hiding this information from clients keeps changes from
cascading</b>. So this is the <b>concept of Transparency</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: Builder (97), Iterator (257), Strategy (315),
Template Method (325),Visitor(331).
</p>

<p>
Algorithmic dependencies. <b>Algorithms are often extended, optimized,
and replaced</b> during development and reuse. Objects that depend on
an algorithm will have to change when the algorithm
changes. <b>Therefore algorithms that are likely to change should be
isolated</b>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Personal note:</i> sounds much like transparency and the previous
point. Once you have all the patterns studied and clear in the mind
come back here.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: AbstractFactory (87), Bridge (151), Chain of
Responsibility (223), Command (233), Facade (185),Mediator (273),
Observer (293).
</p>

<p>
Tight coupling. Classes that are tightly coupled are hard to reuse
in isolation, since they depend on each other. <b>Tight coupling
leads to monolithic systems</b>, where you can't change or remove a
class without understanding and changing many other classes. The
system becomes a dense mass that's hard to learn, port, and
maintain. -&gt; Gordian Knot.
</p>

<p>
<b>Loose coupling increases the probability</b> that a class can be reused
by itself and that a system can be learned, ported, modified, and
extended more easily. Design patterns use techniques such as
abstract coupling and layering to promote loosely coupled systems.
</p>

<p>
Note layering - old trick of CS - add a layer of indirection.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: Bridge (151), Chain of Responsibility (223),
Composite (163), Decorator (175), Observer (293),Strategy (315).
</p>

<p>
Customizing an object by subclassing often isn't easy. Every new
class has a fixed implementation overhead (initialization,
finalization, etc.). Defining a subclass also requires an in-depth
understanding of the parent class. For example, overriding one
operation might require overriding another.An overridden operation
might be required to call an inherited operation. And subclassing
can lead to an explosion of classes, because you might have to
introduce many new subclasses for even a simple extension.
</p>

<p>
<b>Object composition in general and delegation</b> in particular
provide flexible <b>alternatives to inheritance for combining
behavior</b>. <b>New functionality</b> can be added to an application by
<b>composing existing objects</b> in new ways rather than by defining
new subclasses of existing classes. On the other hand, <b>heavy use
of object composition can make designs harder to understand</b>. Many
design patterns produce designs in which you can introduce
customized functionality just by defining one subclass and
composing its instances with existing ones.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Design patterns: Adapter (139),Decorator(175),Visitor(331).
</p>

<p>
<b>Inability to alter classes conveniently - these design patterns
fix it</b>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you have to modify a class that can't be modified
conveniently.Perhaps you need the source code and don't have it (as
may be the case with a commercial class library). Or maybe any
change would require modifying lots of existing subclasses. Design
patterns offer ways to modify classes in such circumstances.

This is as well useful; in the sense that you can refer to the

<h2 id="org9079dcb">Logic of OOP that makes some patterns possible</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9079dcb">
<p>
So one of the mayor concept in OOP is the one of <b>dynamic
binding</b>. This allows patterns such as the abstract factory.
</p>

<p>
The essential idea is that when you trigger a method (a request),
the behaviour is not simply defined by the method itself but it is
rather a combination of <b>object</b> and <b>method</b>, this actually
specifies the operation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The run-time association of a request to an object and one of its
operations (methods) is known as <b>dynamic binding</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Side note - the concept is clear. There is just a bit of new
terminology. Do not get confused as everything boils down to:</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dynamic binding means that issuing a request doesn't commit you to a
particular implementation until run-time.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5b3775a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5b3775a">Creational Patterns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b3775a">
<p>
Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to
subclasses, while Creational object patterns defer it to another
object.
</p>

<p>
Note that creational patterns heavy leverage the Java future of
reference variables. See for instance the following snippet for it
on your Java notes in the following section.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org01a7588" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org01a7588">On reference variables using interafaces&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="tag"><span class="reference_variable">reference_variable</span></span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org01a7588">
<p>
This is convenient. Recall that it was possible to define
reference variables as superclasses and to reference then objects
of subclasses. It was then possible to call the different abstract
methods of the superclass that would then trigger the right call
to the actual implementation of it in the subclass.
</p>

<p>
In a similar way it is possible to create reference variables as
interfaces and point then to the different objects of classes
implementing such interface.
</p>

<p>
<b>Any instance of any class that implements the declared interface
can be referred to by such a variable</b>.
</p>

<p>
The exact way the interface is implemented depends then on the
type of object that the reference interface variable points
at. This in a very similar way to what was already explained for
the case of superclass reference variable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> interestingly when you implement a reference variable of
type interface and then refer to an object of some class referring
to that interface you can access all of the methods specified by
the interface via the reference variable but <b>you cannot access
any other members defined in the class</b> implementing the
interface.
</p>

<p>
The method to be executed is looked up dynamically at run time,
allowing classes to be created later than the code which calls
methods on them.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CAUTION Because dynamic lookup of a method at run time incurs a
significant overhead when compared with the normal method invocation
in Java, you should be careful not to use interfaces casually in
performance-critical code.

<div id="outline-container-org45b791d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org45b791d">Factory Methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org45b791d">
<p>
Basically this is the one I was already noting when making some
notes generally about Java.
</p>

<p>
This is very core in order to write a bit of solid code. You have to
understand and interiorize it.
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
decide <b>which class</b> (so you see this pattern is at class level -
meaning compile time) to instantiate.
</p>

<p>
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
</p></li>

<li>So that is basically a <i>virtual</i> constructor via a method.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the idea is essentailly the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-01-28 122956.png" class="center">

<p>
Note that this is called <b>method</b> for a reason. You have actually
here a method in the interface and the ProductOne and ProductTwo in
the above will <b>implement that method constructing an object from
the desired class</b>. So actually the construction happens via method
and not by reference assigning an object to a general
interface. Keep this <i>well into your mind</i>.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-26 155654.png" class="center">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org36549a3"></a>On a side note in debugging<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org36549a3">
<p>
So basically I am working quite a bit on some legacy code. You
should be careful about such factory methods as when you have for
instance interfaces which are implemented by similar but
different objects - possibly in a hierarchical way -, say for
instance <code>AbstractFeed</code> and <code>AbstractQuarterly</code>  (implementing
Abstractfeed) and overwriting some methods, well then you see
that it is easy to get confused.
</p>

<p>
You will notice that factory structure by debugging the thing.

<h3 id="orgef28d32">Abstract Factory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgef28d32">
<p>
This is another pattern that uses the concept of dynamic binding in
OOP.
</p>

<p>
Note that the way it uses such concept is quite elaborated.
</p>

<p>
I will elaborate next but you see that such patterns are indeed
swiss knifes. Meaning it is not something that you implement on the
fly when you program. At least not at the beginning. You have to
make some explicit thinking before and take quite some design
steps.
</p>

<p>
In general this pattern looks as follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-26 162111.png" class="center">

<p>
And to understand that better think of the following
implementation:
</p>

<p>
In this sense understand the following pseudo-code in order to
understand the pattern - note that <b>factory methods</b> are used (you
can also use other patterns such as prototypes there -:

<h3 id="orgce57f56">Builder</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgce57f56">
<p>
You use this pattern in order to create very laborious objects that
require a lot of effort being created.
</p>

<p>
In this sense what you do is to define a builder with all of the
different components that you need for creating the complex
objects. You can then call directly from your client the builder
components that you need to instantiate your complex objects - and
forms, derivatives of it -.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to work with a second type of objects - <i>a
Director</i>.
</p>

<p>
The idea is well sum-up in the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the client code needs to assemble a special, fine-tuned model of a
car, it can work with the builder directly. On the other hand, the
client can delegate the assembly to the director class, which knows
how to use a builder to construct several of the most popular models
of cars.
</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-29 084214.png" class="center">

<p>
So you see for instance in the pattern above that the Director
holds all of the different types of car categories. These are
mapped to the relevant input parameters in the director, which uses
then the general builder objects to create them.

<h3 id="org4ff6140">Prototype</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ff6140">
<p>
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on their
classes.
</p>

<p>
The essential idea why you need a pattern for it is threefold:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s
fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object
itself.</li>

<li>Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate,
your code becomes dependent on that class. If the extra dependency
doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch.</li>

<li>Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but
not its concrete class, when, for example, a parameter in a method
accepts any objects that follow some interface.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
The pattern works as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support
cloning. This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your
code to the class of that object.
</p>

<p>
Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.
</p>

<p>
An object that supports cloning is called a prototype. When your
objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations,
cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The pattern looks as follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-29 091559.png" class="center">

<p>
As always understand it via the concrete case; it is much more
simple to digest it then:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-29 100157.png" class="center">

<p>
So that is it. Quite easy to understand; or maybe I am just getting
into the pattern mentality.

<div id="outline-container-orgab116c2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgab116c2">Singleton</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab116c2">
<p>
This is again the usual concept in CS. It is to have a single
access to the resources or objects such that you apply exclusivity
<code>a la</code> lord of the flies.
</p>

<p>
It is the concept of <i>Single Responsibility Principle</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after
a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh
object, <b>you’ll get the one you already created</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular
constructor since a constructor call must always return a new
object by design.
</p>

<p>
Note that the above is the general concept and people most often
refer as Singleton an Object solving that issue. <b>Important to
note</b> is that it is much more.
</p>

<p>
The general idea for implementing this is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from
using the new operator with the Singleton class.
</p>

<p>
Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the
hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object
and saves it in a static field.
</p>

<p>
All following calls to this method return the cached object.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is as well pretty simple to implement. You can think about it
in the following way:

<p>
Overridden methods are another way that Java implements the “one
interface, multiple methods” aspect of polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
Part of the key to successfully applying polymorphism is understanding
that the superclasses and subclasses form a hierarchy which moves from
lesser to greater specialization.  Used correctly, the superclass
provides all elements that a subclass can use directly. It also
defines those methods that the derived class must implement on its
own. This allows the subclass the flexibility to define its own
methods, yet still enforces a consistent interface.

<div id="outline-container-org7766aa5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7766aa5">Key Concept - Favour Object Composition over Inheritance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7766aa5">
<p>
So in order to understand this, you have to start from the
disadvantages of Inheritance.
</p>

<p>
You can think about it in the following terms:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You can't change the implementations inherited from parent classes
at run-time, because inheritance is defined at compile-time.</li>

<li><p>
Second, and generally worse, parent classes often define at least
part of their subclasses' physical representation. Because
inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent's
implementation, it's often said that "inheritance breaks
encapsulation" [Sny86]. The implementation of a subclass becomes
<b>so bound up with the implementation of its parent class</b> that any
change in the parent's implementation <b>will force the subclass to
change</b>.
</p>

<p>
Implementation dependencies can cause <b>problems when you're trying
to reuse a subclass</b>.
</p>

<p>
This dependency limits flexibility and ultimately reusability. From
here the idea of using <b>object composition</b>.
</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4e17156" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4e17156">Object Composition</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4e17156">
<p>
Object composition is defined dynamically at run-time through
objects acquiring references to other objects.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you encapsulate one object into antoher one. From here the
idea of Object Composition.
</p>

<p>
Because objects are accessed solely through their interfaces, we
don't break encapsulation. Any <b>object can be replaced at run-time
by another as long as it has the same type</b>.
</p>

<p>
Favoring object composition over class inheritance helps you keep
each class encapsulated and focused on one task.
</p>

<p>
So this is the idea of the second principle:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Favor object composition over class inheritance.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nevertheless, our experience is that designers <b>overuse
inheritance as a reuse technique</b>, and designs are often made more
reusable (and simpler) by depending more on object
composition. You'll see object composition applied again and again
in the design patterns.

<div id="outline-container-org2ab9fa7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2ab9fa7">Delegation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2ab9fa7">
<p>
Delegation is a way of making composition as powerful for reuse as
inheritance [Lie86, JZ911]. In delegation, two objects are
involved in handling a request: a <b>receiving object delegates</b>
operations to its delegate - which is encapsulated.
</p>

<p>
The following window example makes quite the point:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Window classmight reuse the behavior of Rectangle by keeping a
Rectangle instance variable and delegating Rectangle-specific behavior
to it.
</p>

<p>
In other words, instead of a Window being a Rectangle, it would have a
Rectangle.
</p>

<p>
Window must now forward requests to its Rectangle instance explicitly,
whereas before it would have inherited those operations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-29 123626.png" class="center">

<p>
Note now the benefit as well, that if you want to change and
create a window with a circle shape you just changing a Rectangle
instance with a <i>Circle instance</i> at run time.
</p>

<p>
Delegation has a disadvantage it shares with other techniques that
make softwaremore flexible through object composition: Dynamic,
highly parameterized software is <b>harder to understand</b> than more
static software. - layer of indirection; solves issues but more
complex. Same as distributed microservices.
</p>

<p>
There are also run-time inefficiencies, but the human
inefficiencies are more important in the long run.
</p>

<p>
Delegation is a good design choice only when it simplifies more
than it complicates.
</p>

<p>
Delegation is an extreme example of object composition. It shows
that you can <b>always replace inheritance with object composition</b>
as a mechanism for code reuse.

<h3 id="org5209e49">Callback Methods</h3>

<h3 id="orga5c8cc4">Anonymous Inner Classes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga5c8cc4">
<p>
This is something quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
Anonymous classes are <i>inner classes with no name</i>.
</p>

<p>
Since they have no name, we can't use them in order to create
instances of anonymous classes.
</p>

<p>
As a result, we have to <b>declare and instantiate anonymous classes in
a single expression at the point of use</b>. -&gt; so essentially this is
ultimately the idea.
</p>

<p>
The way you declare this anonymous inner class with no name is the
following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
new ParentClass (&#x2026;) {}
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ParentClass the class you want to create the inner class in</li>

<li>(&#x2026;) here you have to pass the constructor arguments. Note that
this is <i>necessary</i> as you are creating a new object out of the
box.</li>

<li>{} here you have the methods your anonymous class should implement</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Example
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="c1">// Anonymous class - no name.</span>
   <span class="c1">// It basically is an inner class of the parentclass: Book</span>
   <span class="n">myNewObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Book</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Design Patterns&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// constructors arguments of parent class</span>

<p>
Note that this is essentially it. The question is then why it is an
<i>inner</i> class? Not that clear to me at this stage. I think that the
naming is a bit confusing.
</p>

<p>
Check at the following minor test that I did. You can in fact as
well access the methods of the parent class. So it looks to me
simply as an extended class object. So don't know keep it as an open
