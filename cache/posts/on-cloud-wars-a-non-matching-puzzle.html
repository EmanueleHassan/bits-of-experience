Difficult world, difficult puzzle. 
</p>

<p>
Since I opened the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora's_box">Pandora's box</a> last year by seriously entering the IT
world I learned a lot. My background was not the ideal for the
position, but by now I manage to navigate the system. Some education
on computer architecture and hardware is missing but it will come at
some point&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Still, despite navigating the system, so many pieces are just missing,
and the puzzle does not add up.

I got, and more less digested, multiple hours of training. Though the
situation is pretty much the one of Plato's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Allegory of the Cave</a></i>. We
are children learning by looking at shadows, what happens behind us is
unknown. What happens in the real world is even less known. 
</p>

<p>
When you get a training, you usually get it on a very specific
technology. You are looking at your thumb thinking that it is the
moon.
</p>

<p>
The understanding of the big picture is missing. You can become an
expert in one technology. But without the understanding of the big
picture, you cannot be visionary. You follow the market and do not
shape it with your technology. You do not know how to adapt the
technology. You do not know which new technology to learn. You do not
know how to sell the technology.
</p>

<p>
Hence, it is up to you to compose the puzzle and gain that vision, but
that is a very hard job. The market is complex. The speed of
development is huge. And clouds are not just about a segment. They
span pretty much everything: hardware (be it storage, compute and
networking machines), software (from databases, ERP, to high end
applications), software management tools, software migration tools,
virtualization technologies etc. etc..
</p>

<p>
You understand that it is pretty much impossible to be an expert of
each. Still you have to have a solid knowledge of each to understand
the big picture.
</p>

<p>
So while I am in the middle of the process I still do not understand
the market. 
</p>

<p>
How come that players as big as the incumbents still did not
modularize their architecture? 
</p>

<p>
It is what they teach you at University from the very beginning. If
the workloads are not mission critical where performance is absolute
key don't work at the hardware level. Modularize.
</p>

<p>
So why are incumbents still keeping their focus so tight to hardware
infrastructure, while in 21st century it is clear that the glue and
the competitive advantage lies in software? How come that they are
aiming at entering the hybrid cloud space with products such as
outposts and fiji?
</p>

<p>
It really looks to me as if they are leveraging their share size to
expand in the hybrid space. The promise is to offer a consistent
experience in terms of APIs and software services across the public
and private cloud. For a company going all in with a single cloud
provider, having applications where lift and shift is simply not
possible it might well make sense. But the lock in is tremendous, so
why not to modularize and offer such experience through a software
layer and addressing the needs of the bigger market?
</p>

<p>
It seems to me weird that such companies with such a great minds
working in them have a so narrow strategy. The strategy would make
sense if they are able to offer services at a fraction of the costs
working with some very advanced hardware infrastructure, but as far as
my knowledge goes that is not the case. Maybe this is their aim.
</p>

<p>
And again, who would buy their proprietary infrastructure and hold it
on their private cloud (assuming no saving in costs) when the benefit
of elasticity of the cloud (and its pay as much as you use) concept is
gone?
</p>

<p>
Finally, why should you buy storage volumes from the cloud providers
and migrate your private cloud storage infrastructure on their
infrastructure when you can use technologies such as Openshift
Container Storage to use your current storage infrastructure and
obtain a public cloud development and operations experience on the
platform?
</p>

<p>
Still too many questions and too little understanding, as by far as I
understand there would really be no game in town at the strategic
level.
