Since ants are the official theme of the family, here a story of an
ant in New York.  
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-orgc6ba7c4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc6ba7c4">On a General Impression</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc6ba7c4">
<p>
I still remember&#x2026;. I arrive at the airport, do the security check,
I pick the subway, get off at Lexington Avenue and
wow&#x2026; breathtaking, huge skyscrapers all around me. So tight to
each other. 
</p>

<p>
I remember the first 24 hours I was walking with my head
up. Wondering around, looking at these huge buildings. Feeling like
an ant. 
</p>

<p>
I noted that clouds seems to move faster in the New York skies. I
think that this is because the sight is less dispersed and can
capture better the movement in the small distance that separates the
giants climbing in the skies. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; ADD video of clouds in times square &#x2013;
</p>

<p>
Then you start wondering what the reasoning was to build a city like
this. Why it emerged as a decision while many other EU wealthy
countries did not decide to build high in the sky.
</p>

<p>
Is it a - <i>I wanna be</i> - syndrome? The way of saying, we are the
greatest country in the world and we prove it by creating
an entire city scraping the sky. 
</p>

<p>
Sure is that even if you forget about it after a while, you will
always feel little in a city as this. The city reminds you
constantly how big man can achieve and how you will always stay a
little ant as individual in a society that collectively reaches
greatness. 
</p>

<p>
You then start to wonder how such big skyscrapers can be
maintained. Such large buildings and infrastructure. That is not a
trivial task and I must say that you already start to experience
some signals of rotting across the cities. Some of the buildings
that were clearly the glory of the cities a few decades ago are now
poorly maintained and have a feeling of a lost greatness that cannot
be maintained anymore. 
</p>

<p>
As I am writing this piece of memories, I stopped and did some
googling. The issues are confirmed. Nonetheless it seems that NY had
many dark periods throughout history. See for instance in 1977 with
the almost bankruptcy, the trash and the mega-rats. It did recover
then and it might recover now.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, it was as well interesting to see the building
infrastructure in NYC. Never saw a platform so big&#x2026; probably this
is how they construct these block-large skyscrapers.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; ADD picture of platform construction &#x2013;
</p>

<p>
As a final note, it is also interesting to note that skyscrapers in
New York are not simply tall but fat as well. This is what makes
them particular. They can span an entire block and with they shiny
lobbies full of christmas decorations and hannukkiah they leave you
without words. 
</p>

<p>
Ahh.. and side fact. It is fun to see how many jewish people there
is NYC and how the jewish tradition is represented everywhere. Very
welcoming.

I am pretty sure these shops were out of the area where they are
required by law to install the luminous shields.

<p>
Decided to watch the <i>phantom of the opera</i> - the most classical
one. Purchased the ticket at discount at the tkts store in times square.
</p>

<p>
Well done. Very nice one and worth the experience. 
</p>

<p>
You can view very similar performances in other cities. I recall
the show on Matilde I watched in London.
</p>

<p>
I would not say that the level there was any lower. 
</p>

<p>
I think in this sense it must be a little bit inflated the idea
of <i>Broadway</i> but still a very nice experience.

Little Italy quite horrible actually.

Chinatown better but still nothing wow.

<p>
Tried the Joe's Shanghai restaurant. Was supposed to be extremely
good. People queuing etc. Took something, was good but nothing
ultra-good. Van set the bar now and I think that it is quite a high
one in terms of chinese restaurants&#x2026;. ohh I still think about
that Munich restaurant at times&#x2026; delicious.

Did not get the vibe it is supposed to be known for.

Also graffiti quite poor..

Checked some galleries. Most too modern and pricey.

Found a nice one. Also too pricey. But noted the style very

<p>
Saw the 9/11 eleven memorial. Huge fountains. The twin towers must
have been extremely big.
</p>

<p>
Also saw Wall Street and the Zurich office. When you see these
monsters the way you look at your work changes. Incredible the
power of these corporate. It comes again to the initial message of
the skyscrapers. At the end they have their figurative power. They
represent the strength of the institutions. And if you think that
you are developing the market risk system that is governing such
monsters well that is impressing and scary.

<p>
Just one sentence. Grande lady Liberty. Great respect for its
values and what it represents.
</p>

<p>
I think part of US values is also because of her. Having such
strong symbols of liberty is not what every country has.
</p>

<p>
Was nice to be there and listen to the audio guide. Very well done
letting the listener be inspired by: <i>liberty enlightening the
world</i>.

<p>
Wonderful Island as well. In the sense that the museum that is
there is very well done. Worth the time. 
</p>

<p>
It will let you better understand why US is a land of
immigrant. Their immense effort to integrate immigrant and build
this great nation as we know it today.
</p>

<p>
When listening to the recordings I could understand very well many
of the issues myself as having moved from my home-land at young age
I had to experience many of the same difficulties myself.

It is not a trivial task to <i>properly</i> integrate into a country and
to fully embrace its culture.

When the team was trying to make something more difficult it was
simply not working. Order in defense is as well important as that
might not allow the opponent to shoot in the most serene way, or
will force them to do that difficult play out of frustration.
