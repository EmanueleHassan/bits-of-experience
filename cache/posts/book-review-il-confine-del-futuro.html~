<p>
So I recently finished the books I was reading. I was out of books
and did not want to go buy some in a book-shop; here they mostly
sell books in German and I rather prefer to read books in
English&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So I started to search in my room where I found the book - Il
Confine del Futuro - a book by an IBM Research Scientist about
Artificial Intelligence my family gave me about 2 years ago; when
they got that I was interested in the subject.
</p>

<p>
It was nice of them - I even found some writings wishing me good
luck for the new adventure - each in his personal way reflecting
the character&#x2026; Was nice and fun to read them.
</p>

<p>
Anyways&#x2026; I did not read it at first&#x2026; the title sounded too
vague. The classical book leveraging the buzz, trying to outline and
solve questions for which there is no answer.
</p>

<p>
Being the left-over I started to read it and in two evenings I was
over with it. It is quite some light book that you can go over
quickly. Here my sum-up.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/confine-del-futuro-dellintelligenza-artificiale-ebook/dp/B07P5TVJVB">Il Confine del Futuro</a> (Francesca Rossi):
</p>

<p>
So particular book. If you want to go in the nitty-gritty of the
topic that is not the right book for you. It is quite high-level
and this is the reason why it has average reviews on Amazon.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I partly agree with the people. On the one hand,
you can clearly see that the author did not go the extra mile in
writing the book but simply leveraged the name, the position, and
the buzz for the topic for selling the book. In this sense there
is a bit too much of auto-reference that when not backed by
interesting content might hurt some reader. That was proved by the
Amazon reviews, nobody likes ego-centric people.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, you might appreciate that is so high
level. After all the author already excuses at the beginning for
it and tells the public that is interested in the specifics of the
subject to search for handbooks somewhere else. I can understand
it, that is the ultimate difference between a <i>textbook</i> and a
<i>book</i>. Moreover, I think that there is value even in a
non-obsessed and 100%-effort book or writing. After all, in such a
way it is possible to write quick and dirty content going to the
gist of the problem without loosing too much time on petty
details. Of course you should have the skills to do that but I
think that the author has the authority to do that.
</p>

<p>
In this sense I think that the author manages well to bring some
<i>meta-level</i> thinking when talking about AI and machine
learning. This is typical of italian people, we are platonic by
education.
</p>

<p>
When thinking in these terms, I think that it is possible to say
that it is a good book - it manages well to reach what a textbook
cannot get - a high level, non-complicated, overview of the topic.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, I found of particular interest in the book the
following elements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the difference between slow and fast thinking.
</p>

<p>
I like that differentiation and I never thought about it in such
an explicit way. <a href="https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/ID28756725.html">There is a book</a> that goes over it - probably I
should read it nextish.
</p>

<p>
That is a very nice concept that I immediately applied to the
book when reading it. It is kind of interesting how all of the
concepts expressed in the book are nothing new to anyone working
or dealing with AI/machine learning/applied
statistics.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we get acquainted about all of that common
knowledge as a side effect of doing some work; i.e. we get it in
the fast way of thinking without making it ever explicit. While
in contrast when you read a 100-pages book expressing all of
that common knowledge you are forced to start your slow thinking
process about the topics. Even more when writing a post about it
later then. This activates an entire different way of thinking
about it and it raises new consciousness.
</p></li>

<li><p>
the macro-level differentiation between machine-learning
(learning by example) and the procedural learning (learning by
fix-rule).
</p>

<p>
I think that this differentiation is of particular importance
even if the line gets sometimes blurry when you think about
it. After all everything is a set of instructions - a procedural
learning - and it is not always as easy the difference. You
might well think of machine learning algorithms as being
deterministic, as a well specified set of rules apply to them.
</p>

<p>
This is also where I think that the general public confusion
occurs when talking about black-box.
</p>

<p>
A black-box simply occurs when the algorithm is applied to some
microlevel (say the pixel level), the human is not able to make
sense of. When human are not able to make sense of the input and
how it is transformed as we do not find any connection or simple
storytelling for it, we start to talk about black-box. After all
I never heard anyone talking about black-box for a regression
although the mathematical ultimate concept between the
"black-box neural networks" and regressions is not that far.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you talk about black-box when the information extracted out
of an object is of no practical use for a human being as we are
not able to make sense of it at any level as we cannot read and
interpret that piece of information.
</p>

<p>
That is the ultimate strength of learning by example and the
reason for the buzz around machine learning. You allow to
extract information out of an entire new set of objects, which a
human being is not able to make any sense of.
</p>

<p>
This is the beauty of machine learning and why it is creating so
much buzz. Not the single individual algorithm. Nor a complex
mathematical formula in itself. This is an idea that a <i>book</i>
can bring you but a <i>textbook</i> cannot - or at least not in the
same way as you need a stronger prolonged stimulus to think in
these term and get out of that micro-level thinking you do in
your routine when applying such things.
</p>

<p>
The issue of these black-box models is then that the human has
to go by trial and error to learn these patterns. We have to try
to analyze some microlevel entity and see how it works. You have
then reached the ultimate pure-black-box level so prone to
overfitting.
</p>

<p>
Finger-crossed: you have no idea of why a result occurred but
you just hope and make some mathematical tricks that should
convince you that your results are generalizable and adversarial
resistant.
</p></li>

<li><p>
about the impossibility to distinguish between procedural
learning and learning by example.
</p>

<p>
interesting is that the meta-level that allows a human to get
the idea of an object, is not known to the human in a procedural
way. Also interesting is that it is not an example driven
deducted idea.
</p>

<p>
You are able to think in abstract terms - say a yellow hydra
with the face of a dog - vs <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1nGGpfIgXevFXMyR_JFnghK9lAoUeAXeq1u6D8y-k8arlRarloNdoLz4SFyLE-79neRo&amp;usqp=CAU">by example</a>.
</p>

<p>
Or you can get the idea of quadruple out of a cat. This in
contrast to the case of machine learning where in order to learn
the idea of quadruple you would have to re-index and retrain all
of your data and train again a different algorithm for the
task.. you cannot also ask ML to make a generalization out of a
category as it has no idea on how to do that.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is in this sense to see and think about how we human
are not even conscious ourselves about some structures of our
thinking and decision making. We are black-boxes and this is the
ultimate reason why we need psychologists to remember us such a
thing and tell us that it is okey.
</p>

<p>
However, funny is also the way we cannot accept a black-box
object, pretending that each and every human decision is
motivated by pure rational choices. Note that this tendency is
not just in machine learning but it is pretty much installed in
the human brain of any western person as a core and fundamental
fix-point value. 
</p>

<p>
Well, I see that I am starting to go too much into philosophical
discussion. That is dangerous so I will let it and go back to my
micro-level thinking.

Cheers &amp; maybe it might be interesting for some other individual
than me.
