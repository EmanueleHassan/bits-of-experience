This post is a reference for further work. It is a milestone and a
reminder that such things exists and maybe you will use them at some
point depending on what work will you do.

<p>
So I started to work in a messy project with very big APIs.
</p>

<p>
I am working with Swagger and <code>Openapi</code> specifications. It is a very
cool feature and you can navigate quickly the API with it. Given the
Openapi specification given as a <code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code> it gives you an
overview of all of the different APIs.
</p>

<p>
If they are well written according to the standards you should be able
to quickly read all the possible information relating to the API,
i.e. what you should pass, the schema of the thing you have to pass,
required fields etc.
</p>

<p>
As an end user it is quite practical to use and everything is more
less straightforward.
</p>

<p>
If you have to write it I guess that you would have to read deeper
into it <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">here</a>. If you will work as a data scientist you will probably
not have to deal with it too much.
</p>

<p>
If you will work as a data engineer or machine learning engineer or
architect at some point it might be useful to give it a read at some
point and make some documentation on how to properly set up and
specify APIs and not just to very rough flask APIs.
