This post deals with equilibria in economics theory.
</p>

<p>
I was always fascinated by the topic. I wanted to go in the topic at
some point but I postponed. 
</p>

<p>
Recent experiences just increased that fascination. <i>There is a rhythm
and reason to the wild out there</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is that invisible hand. Even in chaos theory there is an
equilibrium. "Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness
of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns,
interconnection, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity,
fractals, and self-organization." (source: Wiki)
</p>

<p>
I want to study these underlying patterns and the theory economics has
developed to address them. 
</p>

<p>
After all once you understand the rhythm it is just an exercise of
getting the harmonics of the chaos.
</p>

<p>
Note that the notes are based on Starr's: General Equilibrium Theory book.

<p>
The fact is that in the basic courses of economics you simply study
the notion of partial equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
I.e. all things being equal in the particular market the
equilibrium price is where supply and demand curve cross. 
</p>

<p>
Then it simply an exercise of mapping supply and demand curves. 
</p>

<p>
Such curves may shift in time as <i>all things change</i>. But no matter
what, <i>panta rhei</i>; you will get a new equilibrium price for the
specific market and all things being equal it will stay.
</p>

<p>
This book studies the case of <i>general equilibrium</i>. I.e. it is a
microeconomics analysis of the macro equilibrium so to say. That all
things being equal will be treated such that a market affect the
other as it is the case in our complex world. 
</p>

<p>
We will hence treat <i>models</i> that tackle this issue.
</p>

<p>
So you generalize the single market equilibrium condition to the
general equilibrium condition:

<h2 id="org003cd20">Decentralized Markets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org003cd20">
<p>
The assumption in economics is the one of decentralized markets.
</p>

<p>
One of the recurrent notions is to characterize the competitive
market as <i>decentralized</i>. 
</p>

<p>
The idea of decentralization is that the complex interactive
economic system is characterized by many independent decision
makers who do not cooperate explicitly with one another.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, their actions turn out to be consistent with one
another because prices have adjusted for consistency and all the
decision makers respond (separately and independently) to prices
that are common to all.
</p>

<p>
So you have to keep this assumption in mind and decide to what
degree that is fulfilled. It is for sure true but there are things
of national interests where governments kick in.
</p>

<p>
The channel through which they will affect the actors is the one of
the price. So if you understand how the general equilibrium works
you might even get some intuition about the effect of some price
intervention from the governments.
</p>

<p>
You studied all of this at macro-level already. What central banks
are doing is essentially this. 
</p>

<p>
Note that this theory is in between that very high level macro view
and the very micro one.
</p>

<p>
In fact the book addresses the following topics of a general
equilibrium:
