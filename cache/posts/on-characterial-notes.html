<p>
So I possibly just concluded the most stressful week at work that I
have ever experienced. At least so far.
</p>

<p>
I had to take a break from work. Take some rest in order to let the
brain breathe. Take a break in order to let the emotional charge
decompress. Take a break in order to understand what happened.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is a good time to write some notes about it. You learn from
the difficult times and you can take big learnings out of what
happened. 
</p>

<h2 id="org7d0c697">On Trust</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7d0c697">
<p>
This is an important element to me. It is the engine that makes the
social living possible. The engine that rules the world.
</p>

<p>
In order to see this, just think about you driving on a highway. Or
crossing a road in Hanoi.
</p>

<p>
The key point in both of the experiences is <i>trust</i>. Let's stay on
the first example as I guess that most of the people do not have
personal experience about crossing a road in Hanoi.
</p>

<p>
The only way that cars can drive on a highway at 130 km/h is
through trust. I trust the other drivers to stay on their lanes, to
not make sudden and abrupt moves. Once that trust is given, I have
no issues driving next to a car at high speed on a highway. I am
confident that I can overtake the car - or be overtaken - without
endangering anyone.
</p>

<p>
The issue comes when this element completely fades away. When you
do not know anymore who to trust.
</p>

<p>
Imagine driving on a highway where you have zero trust on the other
drivers. Where you in fact start to doubt that your goal - driving
safely on the highway while respecting the rules - and the one of
the other drivers are aligned.
</p>

<p>
You can imagine then that at the first micro-movement on the
highway, be it malicious or not, you may react with a sudden and
abrupt wheel-steering. You can now well imagine that driving on a
highway in such conditions is dangerous. It is a question of time
before a huge incident happens.
</p>

<p>
So this brings me to the following point, without beating about the
bush: <i>how do you drive in big companies where the trust element is
naturally flawed?</i>
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeaf44a3">
<p>
So this I have to take it as given by now. No place and need to
hide, just accept it and control it.
</p>

<p>
I have no mild character and I do not like to be used. Especially
the latter. I have no patience for it. I think that many people
have the belief when working with young people that they dispose
of them.
</p>

<p>
They assume a lack of experience and knowledge and couple it with
the natural fear of the youth that does not know an environment in
order to fulfill their goals.
</p>

<p>
I see it differently, possibly due to my first important employer
that instilled this mentality on me and never used or treated me
superficially but rather as a future resource to invest in.
</p>

<p>
This also goes very well along the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to7nSEcEBJc">this</a> parasha
interpretation. The message is clear and guides you to treat well
people you have influence over. It guides you <i>to have fear</i>,
behave and be accountable when having the power over someone.
</p>

<p>
It guides you not to abuse of people as they are image of Hashem
and not to torture them by asking them to perform work that is
<i>nullifying their soul</i>.
</p>

<p>
Keep it well into your mind as this will make you a great people
manager when it will be the time.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental question in this dimension is the following:
</p>

<p>
<i>How do you deal with people that have influence over you and do
not glorify your soul and ambitions?</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a question I still need to solve. You will always find such
kind of people along your way and you will go for autodistruction
in your career if you will not be able to solve this.

<h2 id="orgc1d5d70">On Big Companies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc1d5d70">
<p>
This brings me to the last point, the one of big companies, where
the two issues above are exacerbated.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, in big companies lots of time managers are not
accountable for misbehaving and abusing of their employees. Often
they are required to do so by some general corporate policy and
strategy. Or simply they must do so in order to get to their
targets which might not involve many important qualitative factors.
</p>

<p>
It is a big chain. Once accountability for the actions is lost,
then all of the chain suffers from it.
</p>

<p>
After all the companies are basically using the human psyche in
order to fulfill their operations:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For in most cases, the evil do not know they are evil. Those who carry
out atrocities don't know they are doing so; they are simply obeying
orders. Or waiting for a promotion.
</p>

<p>
Or doing what they have to do to get on, when all they really want is
to be home, safe and sound.
</p>

<p>
And they worry about their taxes, and about their kids' problems in
school.
</p>

<p>
But as they are thinking about home and wife and bills to be paid,
their hands unthinkingly hold the weapon; their eyes are on the fence
behind which other people are sobbing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Employees feel the situation and lack of purpose, they might even
start to misbehave in order to seek out for revenge.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, competition exacerbates the situation&#x2026; after
all everyone is just waiting for a promotion.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Overall, because of competition among the people and conflicting
goals set to the individuals in order to let problematic situation
arise; the trust condition is difficult to achieve.
</p>

<p>
Basically, you might end up on the crazy highway of section one.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the question here is: <i>how do you contrast the accountability
and competitveness factors arising in big companies?</i>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org74c4997" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org74c4997">On a possible way out</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74c4997">
<p>
So the question is now how to deal with the natural tensions that
emerge at work given the different factors described above.
</p>

<p>
I am reading now a very interesting book: <i>Leaders - by Richard
Nixon</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is very interesting, because apart from giving you a historic
refresher on some of the biggest events of the 20th century it
gives a very colourful description of the personalities behind the
great leaders of the 20th century. A glimpse from a person that
participated in the shaping of the great events of his time and
experienced everything first hand.
</p>

<p>
The great leaders of the century, from <i>Churchill, to De Gaulle,
from Adenauer to Kruscev</i> had very different personalities. From
introvert and reflexive characters to more impulsive and action
based characters. Though, what they had in common is a strong
personality. They never made compromises, believied firmly in some
doctrine and followed it blindly. When they lost they retreated,
studied and awaited their moment. 
</p>

<p>
So this is a lesson learned for you. You can be the one out of a
million or you can create your personality and doctrine. Do not
oppress it; grow it.
</p>

<p>
So turning back to the initial question: how to deal with the
difficult situations as above; my answer is: <i>through ethics</i>.
</p>

<p>
I am convinced in the power of ethics. I am convinced by the fact
that people are moved by purpose and strong ethics creates
purpose. Without it people will get bored at work, will not be
motivated, they will be just moved on economic grounds and the
results will be dire. 
</p>

<p>
So in order to create a great team create a high sense of
greatness, a sense of <i>grandeur</i> a la De Gaulle. A sense of
belonging and accomplishment through achievements.
</p>

<p>
A great team that is ready to cooperate and trust each other in
order to achieve something bigger. A team where its leaders are not
motivated on economic grounds or on power grounds but rather on
grounds of purpose. Then and just then you will have created or you
will be participating in something big. Then and just then you will
not leave the battlefield but rather stay on the pitch until the
last drop of energy leaves up your body. Then and just then you
will find the fulfillment you are searching for at work. Then and
just then you will close up your eyes in the evening and smile
waiting to rise up to new challenges the next morning.
