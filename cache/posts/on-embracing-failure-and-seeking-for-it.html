Today I feel well. I got rejected for a PhD application, the only one
I made in my life, and most likely the last one. But no this post is
not about the usual stuff: "<i>yeah it is ok to fail, I feel well
despite it</i>". Of course I do, by now I understood what matters to me
in life. Nothing that is work related will ever gonna take the smile
out of me, nor put it for what it counts. 
</p>

<p>
Despite it, I want to share and put down to words some thoughts. After
all it is an event that could have changed my life and it is a good
exercise to write a few words about it.

<h2 id="org4645414">On the Notion of Failure and about being Entrepreneurs in Life</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4645414">
<p>
Well, I am gonna tell you - anonymous reader - why I feel well. I like
mess. I like chaos. I like problems. I think that people that know me
well, know it well. 
</p>

<p>
I did not do a PhD application for having a title on my CV, I did it
to seek growth. This is why I did not do an application in a field I
studied, to study it even more and get my certificate. I rather did it
in a new field I highly believe in and I wanted to explore, in a
top-notch University but more important in a research group that
delivers.
</p>

<p>
Seek growth, this is what I did throughout my life, often not taking
the most rational choice but challenging myself. Not maximizing the
chance of success, but searching the right balance of chance of
success * expected personal growth, or something like that. I have all
the life to go back to the norm, but at least when I am young: let me
risk.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning I was more shy and conservative. When I was young I
was quite wild and did not care more than 0 about my mental
education. So when I started University years ago I approached it in a
conservative way. I did what it was required for me to do and nothing
more. With the time I realized I was good at it and that it was too
easy to do my job at it and full stop. 
</p>

<p>
So I started to take more risks, and damn it, I like it. I think that
my personal growth is convex and that is what counts at the end of the
day. I also think that to get that level of growth risks are
unavoidable. 
</p>

<p>
So this is my message, take risks and be entrepreneur in approaching
life, you will have a great deal of fun. And when life will start to
kick you too hard, or when you will start to build up a family and
guarantee a future to your children, well you will then have the time to
become more risk adverse and reposition, knowing how the world looks
like on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon">dark side of the moon</a>.

<h2 id="orgcb75b2d">On Failure-Fuel and on Failure Signal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcb75b2d">
<p>
I must say that in my way of approaching life, I am not sure that the
above counts as failure. After all I managed to arrive and get to the
final phase of the PhD position colloquium in a field that had little
to do with my education and that was by itself very competitive.
</p>

<p>
Much worse would have been to fail the application in your field of
knowledge after so many years of University education. Still there is
a signal in it. You managed to arrive to the final phase just because
you had a particular background, so obviously there is an attraction
to risk taking behavior and particular backgrounds, even by well
respected Professors that should be, by education, very methodic. 
</p>

<p>
Still you failed at the final bit. This means that at the end the
world is pragmatic, it obviously prefers the conventional and a
profile that delivers more historic-based guarantees. This especially
when resources are limited. Take it as a lesson, as the life approach
you are taking is interesting but needs to take that into account on
the long run.
</p>

<p>
In any case once you processed the failure signal and took your lesson
from it, it is important to synthesize the failure as fuel. After all,
failure creates this dimension of problems and mess that I like and it
is your moment to chase growth.

Or to put it in different terms, like a young italian band sings,
<i>life is like a tetris game, the successes vanish while the errors stay
there to give it spice</i>.

<h2 id="org1724eb2">Why not to do a second or third application if seeking growth is the goal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1724eb2">
<p>
Exactly because growth is the goal.
</p>

<p>
I was not sure in the first place that a PhD would make sense. I was
lucky to talk with a very human Prof. and I think that he saw it in me
and he sent me some signals in that direction, i.e. a PhD is not
always the best way to seek growth and that also on the work side you
can make great contributions. 
</p>

<p>
Let's leave it for now and let's take it as fuel for the next coming
challenges. A piece of tetris out of place that has to vanish through time.
