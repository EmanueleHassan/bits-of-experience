<p>
So this is the next piece of the cake. As we transition to the cloud
it makes sense to have the spring-framework in your skillset.

<h2 id="org0ad6f11">General Idea</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ad6f11">
<p>
At its core, Spring offers a container, often referred to as the
Spring application context, that creates and manages application
components.
</p>

<p>
These components, or beans, are wired together inside the Spring
application context to make a complete application, much like
bricks, mortar, timber, nails, plumbing, and wiring are bound
together to make a house.
</p>

<p>
The act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern known as
<i>dependency injection</i> (DI).
</p>

<p>
Rather than have components create and maintain the lifecycle of
other beans that they depend on, a <i>dependency-injected
application</i> relies on a <b>separate entity (the container)</b> to
create and maintain all components and inject those into the beans
that need them. This is done typically through constructor
arguments or property accessor methods.
</p>

<p>
On top of its core container, Spring and a full portfolio of
related libraries offer a web framework, a variety of data
persistence options, a security framework, integration with other
systems, runtime monitoring, microservice support, a reactive
programming model, and many other features necessary for modern
application development.

<h2 id="org1cc33a9">Spring Project Structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1cc33a9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>TacoCloudApplication.java</code> - This is the Spring Boot main class
that bootstraps the project.</li>

<li><code>application.properties</code> - here you can specify the configuration
properties.</li>

<li><code>static</code> - here you save your static files for your application.</li>

<li><code>templates</code> - here you have template files that will be used to
render content to the browser.</li>

<li><code>TacoApplicationTests.java</code> - this is a simple test class that
ensures that the Spring application context loads successfully.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0dd2100" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0dd2100">Gradle Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0dd2100">
<p>
Note that one of the most important thing that you have in your
build configuration is that you deploy to a <code>jar</code> not into a <code>war</code>.
</p>

<p>
Whereas WAR files are perfectly suitable for deploying to a
traditional Java application server, they’re not a natural fit for
most cloud platforms.
</p>

<p>
Although some cloud platforms (such as Cloud Foundry) are capable of
deploying and running WAR files, <b>all Java cloud platforms are
capable of running an executable JAR file</b>. Therefore, the Spring
Initializer defaults to JAR packaging unless you tell it to do
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Basically you can then set up your project with the required
dependecies. In order to do that, always work through
<a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is useful as through it you can get your skeleton for working
with Spring and through it you can quickly jump-start into your
projects.
</p>

<p>
Note that through <i>transitive dependencies</i> you will manage to keep
your build tools lean. This in the sense that by simply specifying
the follwoing dependecies:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</li>

<li>spring-boot-starter-web</li>
</ul>

<p>
You get out of the box dependencies that makes the following
available:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spring’s MVC framework</li>

<li>Embedded Tomcat</li>

<li>Thymeleaf and the Thymeleaf layout dialect</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moreover, you get autoconfiguration libraries that automatically:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Configure the beans in the Spring application context to enable Spring MVC</li>

<li>Configure the embedded Tomcat server in the Spring application context</li>

<li>Configure a Thymeleaf view resolver for rendering Spring MVC
views with Thymeleaf templates.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note that Thymeleaf is a framework to handle the views. This is
front-end stuff. You did some stuff in there in Python but it is not
your bread and butter and neither your main interest. You are rather
interested in the Spring MVC for writing your endpoints and do the
back-end work.
</p>

<p>
Note as well there is a devtools dependency:
<code>spring-boot-starter-devtools</code>. This is handy when programming as
through it you will be able to have quicker updates and
deployments. It achieves similar results as running flask in
debugging mode. But it adds much more to it. There is also this
H2-console that you need to understand better at some later point.
</p>

<p>
Anyways read more into such devtools when you start properly
developing with it. For now focus on the general structure in these
notes.

   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Through the Spring framework you know that this will be the entry
point for your application and its <code>main</code>.
</p>

<p>
You see that you call then the static <code>run</code> method. This does the
actual bootstrapping of the application, creating the <b>application
context</b> we mentioned before.
</p>

<p>
Note that you pass to the <code>run</code> method:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <b>configuration class</b></li>

<li>the <b>command-line arguments</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that in the example above the configuration class is the same
as the <i>bootstrap class</i>. This does not have to be the case.
</p>

<p>
We will see that in fact the larger the projects - the more you
usually work with separate classes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a4b3f9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3a4b3f9">MVC - through it you write your back-end endpoints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3a4b3f9">
<p>
This is a web-framework.
</p>

<p>
At the center of it there is the concept of <i>controller</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is a class that handles requests and responds with
information. I.e. it is the class through which you classically
implement your endpoints.
</p>

<p>
So in order to implement the most basic endpoint you can work as
follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nn">myCoolPackage</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.stereotype.Controller</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="nd">@Controller</span> 
   <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HomeController</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">@GetMapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">home</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;home&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Note that the <code>@Controller</code> annotation doesn't do much. It is there
to identify the class as a component. This will be useful as you
will do some component-scanning in your Spring-application context
then.
</p>

<p>
I.e. through the annotation Spring’s component scanning
automatically discovers it and creates an instance of
Home-Controller as a bean in the Spring application context.
</p>

<p>
The <code>@GetMapping</code> is there to note that the endpoint will work with
GET requests. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org97f9ca8">Endpoints Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org97f9ca8">
<p>
You can check in the book. This will be a quite big waste of time
nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Start first by deciding on which tests suite you want to use. All
of these books explain you the stuff pretending there would be just
a single way of doing it.
</p>

<p>
This is not the case. So get the general structure and idea. But do
not spend too much time on it now on doing documentation. You might
use then a complete different testing-suite.

<h2 id="orgfc34d2b">Important Spring Modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfc34d2b">
<p>
Note that on that spring initialzer page you can see all of the
dependencies nicely integrated with the spring framework.
</p>

<p>
You can navigate it in detail in time.
</p>

<p>
However, in general there are macroscopic classes, that you need to
understand:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge5a0c1f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge5a0c1f">Core Spring Framework</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge5a0c1f">
<p>
This is the fundation of everything in the spring universe.
</p>

<p>
It provides the core container and dependencies injection
framework.
</p>

<p>
It also provides the following essential features:m
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spring MVC</li>

<li>Template based JDBC support</li>

<li>Spring WebFlux (for <b>reactive</b> programming)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org91b9dc4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org91b9dc4">Spring Boot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91b9dc4">
<p>
This is what makes autoconfiguration and starter-depencies
possible.
</p>

<p>
Note that the starter-dependencies are exactly the thing we
mentioned. I.e. you specified these very general
<code>spring-boot-starter-xxx</code> dependencies and through it you get a ton
of others transitive dependencies and autoconfigurations of them.
</p>

<p>
Note that Spring Boot also allows the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Actuator</b> provides runtime insight into the inner workings of
an application, including metrics, thread dump information,
application health, and environment properties available to the
application.</li>

<li>Flexible specification of environment properties.</li>

<li>Additional testing support on top of the testing assistance found
in the core framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spring Boot offers an alternative programming model based on Groovy
scripts that’s called the Spring Boot CLI (command-line
interface). With the Spring Boot CLI, you can write entire
applications as a collection of Groovy scripts and run them from
the command line.
</p>

<p>
Not interesting to me. It is another layer of config. It seems that
this Groovy is quite some config language in the Java world as it
is used for both specifying things in Gradle as well as here in
Spring at macro-level.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a852db" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3a852db">Spring Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3a852db">
<p>
What’s more, Spring Data is capable of working with a <i>several
different kinds of databases</i>, including relational (JPA), document
(Mongo), graph (Neo4j), and others.
</p>

<p>
So interesting altough as mentioned I do not like to work with such
interfaces as then you stick too much into a single language.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to work with the native declarative languages of each as
these are quite stable and will provide the necessary portability
across languages.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a2a46e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7a2a46e">Spring Security</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7a2a46e">
<p>
Through it you can manage a broad range of application security
needs, including authentication, authorization, and API security.
</p>

<p>
This is what you did in your last Flask project. So similar
thing. Was never a fun of it. I hope I will not have to dig too
much into it. However, with the Zero-trust Architecture paradigm I
might have to do that at some point. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9126655" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9126655">Spring Integration and Spring Batch</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9126655">
<p>
<b>Spring Integration</b>: addresses real-time integration where data is
processed as it’s made available.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spring Batch</b>: addresses batched integration where data is allowed
to collect for a time until some trigger (perhaps a time trigger)
signals that it’s time for the batch of data to be processed.
</p>

<p>
So this will be important as with it you can push the boundaries
of your market risk system and make a nice machine out of it. It
will be very important in this sense to master functional
programming and these frameworks in order to have a proper baby.

<div id="outline-container-orgb385f2c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb385f2c">Spring Cloud</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb385f2c">
<p>
Microservices are a hot topic, addressing several practical
development and runtime concerns. In doing so, however, they bring
to fore their own challenges. Those challenges are met head-on by
Spring Cloud, a collection of projects for developing cloud-native
applications with Spring.
</p>

<p>
So that is interesting and what Sergio was mentioning. I am
interested in looking into it as many things were provided by
external dashboards on the cloud from my experience at IBM.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in this sense to understand how that is working
and how exactly is it monitoring things given that the things work
in different runtimes.

<p>
With it you can both display information to the front-end in a
dynamic way.
</p>

<p>
Or, alternatively, it will be possible for you to develop REST
endpoints with it.
</p>

<p>
I will not make big notes of the first. It is not my bread and
butter. Note that it is pretty much what you saw at the times of
your IBM projects when you worked with flask.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you serve the static content via MVC, and you have different
<code>views</code>, through which it is possible to embedd the application
logic into the front-end.
</p>

<p>
The book worked with Thymeleaf as a view framework in order to
embedd the application logic into the front-end. We work with
Mustache. Though, you can imagine that the two are quite similar -
and again, from what you can read this is exactly what you could
see when working on your flask-login module. 
</p>

<p>
Note that in general you always talk with the controller when
instatiating the HTTP request. Then you perform your application
logic and pass on the relevant info to the views.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org920fa59" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org920fa59">Spring Data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org920fa59">
<p>
So we will treat here how to interact with JDBC and JPA in Spring.
</p>

<p>
Note that the difference between the two is the level of
abstraction. Through JDBC you communicate directly with the DB by
passing SQL queries and interacting with the driver of the DB.
</p>

<p>
JPA is the higher level of abstraction. There you can work with the
first-class citzens of java: objects. Check your other post where
you digged a little bit more deeper into them.
</p>

<p>
Note that these notes are just approximate. You make sense of the
java way of developing in here. Note that you should then just refer
to these to get the gist of the idea when creating your first
restful service with data persistence.
</p>

<p>
You should then create the most logical and classical way for
persistence using the following repository holding the code for the
application in a unified way: <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/tree/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/java/tacos">here</a>.

<div id="outline-container-org98faa23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org98faa23">Spring JDBC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org98faa23">
<p>
Spring JDBC support is rooted in the JdbcTemplate class.
</p>

<p>
JdbcTemplate provides a means by which developers can perform SQL
operations against a relational database without all the ceremony and
boilerplate typically required when working with JDBC.
</p>

<p>
So basically with jdbc you do not have to handle all of the
connections and the error messages explicitely. So the module in Java
helps you to work without all of the boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
I like this code as it is more lean than without the templates.

<h3 id="orgdfc6181">Reading from RDMS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdfc6181">
<p>
You would do that in the follwoing way leveraging on the JDBC templates
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="c1">// Note how you focus on the query in here. No connection is handeled. </span>
 <span class="nd">@Override</span>

  <span class="s">&quot;select id, name, type from Ingredient where id=?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">mapRowToIngredient</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span>  
 <span class="p">}</span>

 <span class="c1">// Your function for mapping queries to results.</span>
 <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="nf">mapRowToIngredient</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ResultSet</span> <span class="n">rs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">rowNum</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">SQLException</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Ingredient</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">rs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="n">rs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>

 <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Note that the <code>queryForObject</code> above maps the query to a single
object.
</p>

<p>
If you want to map each row of the query to an object which you then
would save in a <b>Collection</b> you can use the <code>query</code> method. Check
the below in this sense:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="nd">@Override</span>
 <span class="c1">// note the Collection result here.</span>
 <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Iterable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Ingredient</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">findAll</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">jdbc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;select id, name, type from Ingredient&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

 <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
So basically that is how it works. you just have then to embedd such
methods into a class that is initialized with jdbc template.
</p>

<p>
You can do that as <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/blob/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/java/tacos/data/JdbcIngredientRepository.java">here</a>. Note as well the constructor with
<code>@Autowired</code> there. This is a Spring specific annotation in order to
get things in the context etc. Note as well the installation of
<code>RowMapper</code>. Note that this necessary as the second argument of the
<code>query</code> etc. is in fact a rowmapper and the referenced methods are
interenally treated as such. You can find in the book an example on
how to work explicitely with Rowmapper but this is not in my interest
as it just clutters the code.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgeb3c248">Writing to RDMS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb3c248">
<p>
To write into the RDMS using JDBC template you can use the
<code>update</code> method.
</p>

<p>
You can do that in the follwoing way
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nd">@Override</span>
   <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="nf">save</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="s">&quot;insert into Ingredient (id, name, type) values (?, ?, ?)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getId</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getName</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getType</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="na">toString</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Because it isn’t necessary to map ResultSet data to an object, the
<code>update()</code> method is much simpler than <code>query()</code> or
<code>queryForObject()</code>.
</p>

<p>
There is then a messy section about writing the stuff in the DB
when you have to make sure all of the keys relations are
satisfied. I jumped it as it is not well written. In this book you
do not have an overview of what piece of code is written were, so I
thought I will understand at the time of getting my hands dirty
with it. So wait for it and tackle this down at a later point.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">create</span> <span class="n">table</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="n">exists</span> <span class="nf">Ingredient</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">id</span> <span class="nf">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="nf">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">,</span>

   <span class="p">);</span>

<p>
Now the question is if you want to do it like that in Java or not.
</p>

<p>
I like the idea as this is plain SQL. So you can keep it in your
project repo. You can moverover generate the schema for localhost
embedded DB as H2 where you can test and work in dev mode.
</p>

<p>
Moreover once everything defined you can run the same sql file to
populate your DB of interest.
</p>

<p>
If you take this approach you just have to make sure that the H2
embedded DB has the same SQL dialect as the server you are using
and make all of these kind of reasoning. 
</p>

<p>
So the question is how do you execute the schema definition above?
</p>

<p>
Again Spring comes at rescue. In the moment where you will save the
stuff in the proper repo and adhere to some basic convention the
file <b>will be executed</b> against the DB when the application
starts.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you should save the file as <code>schema.sql</code> in the
<code>src/main/resources</code> repo.
</p>

<p>
You can find the example fo the book <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/tree/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/resources">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can as well pre-populate the DB with some records by writing
some insert statements in a <code>data.sql</code> file also saved on the same
repo.

<h2 id="org1f5ee17">Configuring Spring</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1f5ee17">
<p>
So basically Spring it is nice cause you have all of your beans in
spring that will ultimately be injected in your context and you will
have a well rounded Java development environment
