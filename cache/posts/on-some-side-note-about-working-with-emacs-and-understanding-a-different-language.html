Very nice. I had a quick break from standard working related stuff.
</p>

<p>
Taking some time to structuring better the workflow.

So here is a reminder for you. I did not expect the java ecosystem to
be such a monster to tackle down.
</p>

<p>
I think that staying in the industry for the next couple of decades -
ecosystem and languages changes will happen at some point.
</p>

<p>
So here some reminder from this experience of yours.
</p>

<p>
Basically I started too soon to the transition to emacs. I discovered
at my own cost that this was not the smoothest way to start with it.
</p>

<p>
I mean I am still a huge emacs fan and will continue with and
continued to work with it throughout this period with org-mode and
shell. Have to make still a major modification there as I discovered
how to work with bash there and have to switch to multi-term for my
shell but yeah that is another discussion and will come at some
point.
</p>

<p>
In any case back to the sense of this post. I discovered essentially
the following: when switching to a major ecosystem - like java - work
first in the standard way with a standard IDE. This will help you to
understand the basic mechanism of working properly in the language and
how you operate with it. Then the emacs embedded programming modes
will borrow a lot from the major IDEs. But you will have a bit of
terminology etc. and that will be necessary in order to properly
understand a couple of config that you will have to take care in
either case in emacs.
</p>

<p>
This is in fact what happened with me in my experience in the java
ecosystem. I tried to set it up at the beginning and work with
it. Could not understand much.
</p>

<p>
Now I worked a couple of months with Eclipse. I understood a couple of
things. Got back this afternoon on emacs lsp-java and could understand
much more.
</p>

<p>
I think I am slowly ready to work with emacs as well in Java. Ready to
stay 100% in the emacs ecosystem and now I should be able to create
multi-buffers and windows, move much more swiflty across them,
leverage projectile and magit to the fullest and that should give me
soon quite some other performance boost which is cool.
