Wow&#x2026; everything is a fight on this new system.
</p>

<p>
even with nikola there were some issues. first of all I was getting an
execute-error concerining some zipped-function defined in the markdown
file. the solution for it was to downgrade to a <a href="https://forum.drawbot.com/topic/247/markdown-syntax-for-formattedstring">previous version of
markdown</a>. Actually it turned out that was not that important in the
first place as the very root cause was not cause by some missing/malfunctioning
python packages but rather by the following.

<p>
The issue is created as you imported the nikola project that was built
on unix OS. Now I did not go into the internal mechanism of Nikola in
a deep way&#x2026; Though, what I think is that you use a <code>sqllite</code> alike
way to operate in an RDMS like way with files on your file system -
i.e. you have an RDMS alike interface without the need to set up and
use a proper database.
</p>

<p>
Nonethess the way the files through which you manage such SQL
compability are named (in terms of file extension) and the way they
operate on different OS is different. Hence when you port your blog
from one OS to the next you should pay attention to such detail.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to generate a dummy blog with the command
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola init --demo mysite
</pre></div>

<p>
Then you will find the basic structure with the necessary DB-alike
files.

<p>
Not having a native bash language on my laptop I could not use the
bash scripts I wrote in order to automate the deployment of my
blog.
</p>

<p>
What I did in order to solve that is to write some lisp function in
order to trigger some <code>eshell</code> functions that operates in an bash
alike way.
</p>

<p>
The workflow is not that smooth that far but it should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Here the steps you need to perform for the deployment. Automate even
further when you have time.

<p>
trigger the <code>blog/move_blog_files()</code> function you defined. this
will copy all of the static resources of your blog to
<code>blog/output/images</code>.
</p>

<p>
note that it is not important from where you trigger such function
in your file system as I specified the correct change of directory
in there.

First deploy via <code>nikola github_deploy</code>. Then call the
<code>blog/push_resources_to_blog()</code> function to copy all of the static
files used by the blog into the deployed branch.
