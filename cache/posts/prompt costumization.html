This month I started to work for the first time with a Mac OS. 
</p>

<p>
As this recently became my primar working OS I immediately started by
downloading <i>emacs</i> and customize the editor in order to optimize my
workflow.
</p>

<p>
Annoyingly after pinning the Emacs executable to the Mac Dock and
launching Emacs from there I got troubles with the <code>$PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
Emacs launched in such a way will not inherit the <code>$PATH</code> specified
within the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file nor will the <code>M-x shell</code> command of
emacs display a nice prompt.
</p>

<p>
This article goes over my fix and the way I customized my set up to
get a nice informative prompt in the terminal.

<h2 id="org960e09d">The Issue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org960e09d">
<p>
The issue turn out to be rather trivial. Launching Emacs executable
directly and not from the terminal will imply that Emacs will not have
the Terminal.app as a super process at any level so that Emacs cannot
inherit anything form the shell in Terminal.
</p>

<p>
This will mean that you have to make the environment the same by sourcing the same files.
</p>

<p>
In this sense I decided to create a single <code>.bashrc</code> file where to
configure my entire terminal options and to refer to this set-up in my
<code>.bash_profile</code> file through the following command.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org06198bf">
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi 
</pre>

<p>
Once this is set up you can finally modify your set up so that <code>M-x
shell</code> as well as your standard terminal prompt will display the information you like.
</p>

<p>
In my specific case, I decided to go for
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2a34a60">
export PS1="(\d) \u@\w[\j]\$"
</pre>

<p>
This will allow me to read the current data at first (as I am
especially bad at them this is a nice reminder for myself).  On top of
that I will have an overview on the user, the working directory as
well as the processes managed by the shell. Especially the last
information is necessary for me as when running processes in the
background I can easily forget about them. Finally I add the
additional information on whether I am leveraging the root user or
not.
