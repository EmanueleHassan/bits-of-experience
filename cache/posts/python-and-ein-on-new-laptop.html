Nothing for the public. 
</p>

<p>
This is a very personal post in order to understand how you work on
the new laptop. 
</p>

<p>
I have no time to dig deeper right now and fix the workflow. Have to
go with these shortcuts.

I did not use the laptop I am working with now for a longer
period. Turned out that the download of some libraries was not
working smoothly anymore. 
</p>

<p>
Something was not working anymore with the compiler. 
</p>

<p>
Decided to install Python again. I canceled the older version of
python I was working with before. 
</p>

<p>
There was an issue though. 
</p>

<p>
There was a python shipped with my Emacs. It is the first one that
is read on the <code>PATH</code> as I did not want to mess up my emacs and
potentially it requires that python given it is in its binaries, I
decided to work in the following way.
</p>

<p>
Create a new virtual-environment for each new project, which in any
case is a good habit and strategy. 
</p>

<p>
I do this by executing in the virtual environments folder:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">   </span>C:/Users/marco/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/python.exe<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span>nikolaEnv
</pre></div>

<p>
Then I activate the specific virtualenvironment and download the
relevant libraries there. I work then in the specific virtualenvironment.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="orgf179c8a">EIN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf179c8a">
<p>
With emacs Ipython notebooks I have as well issues at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
There is a way around it. Work in such a way. Then go back to it if
you need. 
</p>

<p>
I.e. you get an error when starting the notebook server via the
lisp method. 
</p>

<p>
The solution is to start the server via a shell command. 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">   </span>c:/Users/marco/Desktop/python_venv/jupyterEnv/Scripts/jupyter.exe<span class="w"> </span>notebook<span class="w"> </span>--notebook-dir<span class="o">=</span>c:/Users/marco/Desktop/EIN/<span class="w"> </span>--no-browser
</pre></div>

<p>
Then you can simply work in emacs by running the <code>ein:login</code>
method. Then everything is working as usual. 
</p>

<p>
You can execute the above with <code>ein:jupyter-server-start</code> and then
executing <code>ein:login</code> next.
</p>

<p>
Start the <code>.ipynb</code> in emacs case you are having issues connecting
to it in org.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5691a23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5691a23">Images</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5691a23">
<p>
Images generated in emacs are not displaying correctly within it. 
</p>

<p>
It might be an issue related to <code>imagemagick</code>. Always recall to
install an emacs version that is compiled with it. 
</p>

<p>
In any case you can work with the browser for the visualization of
the images. 
</p>

<p>
You can then save them where-ever you want and keep your org files
neat.
</p>

<p>
The session is shared such that the overhead is neglectable.
