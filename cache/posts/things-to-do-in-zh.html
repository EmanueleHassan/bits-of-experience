This is a personal post where I keep some personal activities/places I
am aim to visit at some point.
</p>

<p>
I am further structuring this post. I am adding a movie
section. Moreover, I will start to briefly write some memories and
personal thoughts for the completed activities.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Life_(TV_series)">After Life</a> (2019 - ):
</p>

<p>
This is a Netflix series.
</p>

<p>
Outstanding. I really like it. It teaches you to put things in
perspective. The thing that you should be better able to deal
with.
</p>

<p>
It teaches you the importance of a full life. It teaches you the
importance of the little things that you often forget in the life
that you are living.
</p>

<p>
It teaches you how hard life can hit. It teaches you to never
surrender. To stay strong.
</p>

<p>
It teaches you not to judge people by their status.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, it has a lot of humour such that it is greatly
recommended. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick,_Tick..._Boom!_(film)">Tick tick&#x2026; Boom</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie because of the story. Also nice to see New York and be
able to recognize all of the places. 
</p>

<p>
It is as well possible to better understand what Broadway truly
is. Maybe in this sense I did the wrong decision in going to watch
one of the big classic. Next time I should rather go and watch
something more modern and even an off-broadway one. 
</p>

<p>
I think the music was not that great. The musical component in the
way it was framed does give a light touch to the tragedy of the
movie. I think that something in the process gets lost though. It
could have been a more intense movie looking at the story without
having much clue on the underlying character. 
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was best depicted as that but this just people with a
bigger knowledge of the person and events than me can say.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_of_God_(film)">E stata la mano di Dio</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
Another great movie of Paolo Sorrentino. After <i>La grande
bellezza</i> he hit the target again.
</p>

<p>
A different movie. Less poetic. Less vanity. More sorrow.
</p>

<p>
I think the movie is beautiful as is his message. Not clear, not
straight, obscure as often in his movies.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is free to interpret it his way. I like to think that the
message of the movie is all in the 2 minutes when he talks with
the movie director.
</p>

<p>
For 90 min. Sorrentino shows us the <i>lousy world</i>. The one that we
always have - one way or the other - to face and swollow.
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly, that 5 min. talking. That message:
</p>

<p>
do not break down.
</p>

<p>
do not loose your integrity.
</p>

<p>
do not come undone.
</p>

<p>
that <i>"non ti disunire"</i>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://zff.com/en/archive/85998/">All these Sons</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
Very beautiful, went there with friends at the zurich film
festival. 
</p>

<p>
It was beautiful cause even two protagonists of the movie were
present after the movie for a Q&amp;A session.
</p>

<p>
Incredible what is still happening in 21st century. Every time you
think that racial issues are over. But than badaboom. You
understand that you live in a bubble. That realities very far from
your own one exists. Rough realities, were that some sporadic
heros try to make better.
</p>

<p>
Also interesting how they approach everything as a fight of will
and how they simply push the young people to look at themselves
differently. All the rest will follow. A rethoric I highly agree
with, as I think that things are not difficult to do. Everything
is a matter of will; it's just that finding the will and the
motivation for doing things in a difficult world like ours is not
always that easy.
</p></li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hF5HnVdIqI">Rue 8 de l'Humanite</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
Alors, très jolie le film.
</p>

<p>
Très amusant - il respect la traditionne de le cinèma fracaise.
</p>

<p>
Quand je l'avais regarde, j'ai eu un coup. Il n'est pas possible
que on avait vraimont vécu cette historie.
</p>

<p>
Ancor plus amusant était le fait que le même jour que j'avais regarde
le film avec mes pensées délirantes - j'avais mon premiers
symptômes du coronavirus. J'ai été testé positif le lendemain.
</p>

<p>
Encroyable&#x2026; 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtisel">Shtisel</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
I was home over Easter. I watched with the family the third
season. Very nice series. Much better than <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorthodox_(Miniserie)">unorthodox</a>. There
everything was a little bit too much exasperated.
</p>

<p>
This is nice. I would say it's kosher. It well summarizes the
Jewish mentality with all its pro and cons.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKtvrvZC8OY">Il mondo che vorrei</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
This was an interview with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Francesco">Pope Francesco I</a>. It was a good
watch. In a rough world that is hard to navigate is always good to
listen to such people reminding the true christian values on which
the western society build on. These are not values augmenting the
individualism but rather stressing the importance of the community
that we must protect and remind us.
</p>

<p>
The message was centered about fostering a culture of <i>us</i> in
contrast to an <i>egocentric</i> view, in promoting a culture where we
have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhVsgxlYsEA">empathy</a> and care for the others. In refusing a culture of
waste, where if we do not like something, if something creates a
problem or if something/someone does not fit, well we throw it
away, be it a human being or a thing, instead of trying to solve
the problem with it.
</p>

<p>
Good fellow as always Pope Francesco, may he stay healthy.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHi-a1n8t7M">Marriage Story</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Another wow movie. You should remember this when marrying. It
describes in a terrific way how things can go wrong for little
reasons. I mean simply time and divergence of opinions. Things
that you can hardly predict in advance. And still there is love
but auto-destruction kicks in and there is nothing you can do
while you are absorbed by spiral. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Island_(film)">L'isola delle rose</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow! What an incredible story. I love it. It is a daydreamer story
like me. Makes well the point of the italian genius. It lives in a
different dimension. We idealist animals&#x2026;
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En1jkf34xjc">La vita davanti a sé</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Very good movie. Strong like Momo. It is a very mixed movie. It
encompasses many feelings and it is much food for thoughts. There
is not a bottom line to it and it is not a light watch where there
not need to be a bottom line. 
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to write a snippet summarizing it. I liked it. One
of the things I liked was the power of Momo. I guess that a key in
the movie is how the energy of such people when channeled in the
right will make them shine. The weird element of the lion in the
movie goes in this direction. There is a lion / fire in some
people and it can turn to very good or bad outcomes depending on
who is there in the path of such people - be it Madame Rosa or the
other guy.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is also to notice that not the spoiled child, but
rather the suffered one will have the fire. Help such people and
let them shine.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMuQfYdgWxw">Sorelle Macaluso</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow wow wow!!! There are film directors that do movies. They stay in
the daily life of each of us and touch daily topics. Mundane - I
think this is the word.
</p>

<p>
This transcends everything. What a beautiful mind the one of the
movie director. To get the gravity of the life and what each one
of us needs to face in our life and bring it on the big screen in
such a way is simply&#x2026; wow. And the lyrics that goes along the
movie. It's liberty music. Despite the hard life we are able to
face it and go on with such a power. Crazy movie. Possibly one of
the best, if not the best I ever saw.
</p>

<p>
And I usually do not touch or go along the female vs male story. I
do not like dichotomies. But damn it you feel the touch of a
female soul in the movie. And if this is what we missed, give way
to the woman on the big screen.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Story">Marriage Story</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Beautiful movie. I like it cause it treats the drama of the end of
a love story in a realistic way.
</p>

<p>
Too often people want to set reasons in cases where no reason
exists. The beauty of the movie lies here. It shows how love
between people can end because of divergence of opinion and how if
not faced in the correct way can be extremely disruptive.
</p>

<p>
It points out to the importance of being mature and to let things
go the way they are. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUOH8_HYDtA">Cyrano mon Amour</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Good movie. Confirms my personal opinion about French movies:
these are generally the best movies when you look for a light but
tasty watch. The key of the French majesty of movies production is
to bring deep stories in a light way to the viewer while keeping
the importance of the message in the movie.
</p>

<p>
Here and there this specific movie falls into some mainstream,
which might hurt some more sophisticated viewer but generally a
good watch that underlines how sometimes the best in life does not
come by following rigid structures. 
</p>

<p>
Have to watch the Cyrano at some Opernhaus at some point now..
</p>

<p>
Also interesting is that now you can understand better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wnAnIM3cw">the song of
Guccini</a>. I understood the power of the text but some links where
missing and now it clicked.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UijUOy0MmE">The Spy</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Another interesting story that is Israeli-related.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting testimony of the effort of the Israeli society
and its people in order to keep the Israeli dream alive.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, other blood that flew - todah Eliyahu Ben-Shaul
Cohen.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_%26_the_Gun">The Old Man &amp; The Gun</a> (2018):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie and watch. It teaches the importance of elegance and
style in life. That demeanor that everyone wants to have but just
a few achieve. It is funny as basically in the plot the demeanor
of the person completely excuses his acts. You and everyone in the
movie sympathize with him.
</p>

<p>
Just a pity for the end. He did not reach maturity and it lives
you with the doubt that guy was just a psycho. But maybe it was
just in his style and that is the beauty of it. Throwing
everything away to save this little but important thing of
yours.
</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZxoko_HC0">Green Book</a> (2018):
</p>

<p>
Very nice movie. It shows how narrow minded people can easily
be.. Talking and acting just based on habits and norms without
questioning the system and going further. There is a convenience
in doing that, which is undeniable. Best things happen though if
you managed to transcend it.
</p>

<p>
Also very important the motive of dignity in Doc. Shirely.
</p>

<p>
I liked a lot in this sense the quote
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You Never Win With Violence. You Only Win When You Maintain Your Dignity.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
beautiful idea and yet so difficult to maintain.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGzKnyhYDQI">Loving Vincent</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. It is kind of a thriller. Recommended watch, just
because of the particular painting style it is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It is also a nice watch in the sense that you get easily
transported. 
</p>

<p>
Interesting way to talk about Van Gogh in this particular indirect
way. I think at the end they well manage to give a picture of him.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_a_d%C3%A9j%C3%A0_tes_yeux">Il a déjà tes yeux</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Very nice movie. Extremely funny. I love Manu. But also serious in
the topic. Without ever being too heavy. Very recommended.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYzFieit8dI">Mayerowitz Stories</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Well, there are many movies. Some are different. This is one of
these. Some movies you know from the very beginning what it is
gonna come. This not. It evolves and evolves and evolves and then
it finishes.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice family story.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRADS6wT3nc">Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
It talks about a nice story. It is a story about
integration. Again a typical french comedy. Sometimes fun,
sometimes serious and in general a very pleasant and constructive
watch.
</p>

<p>
The message of the story is the usual. But it is always good to
watch one more movie making the point. Myself as emigrant know
the point. Every time when moving out and entering a new
community you will face opposition. Don't think it is personal it
is just how the world spins. And if you are bright enough then you
will have the courage and the duty to oppose such mechanism and
promote different outcomes like the one in the movie. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKYaEPdcV1g&amp;t=3s">War Dogs</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
Dark comedy crime movie. Interesting cause it is based on a true
story. I generally do not like such kind of movies as they make
the watcher sympathize on bad behaviour by making it <i>hollywood
cool</i>. At the end you enjoy watching it but it is a double edge
sword for the reasons above. If you read it by taking a step back,
there is a learning also in such movie in how even an apparently
good soul as David gets easily tricked by the moment and takes up
bad habits. We all had that kind of Efraim friend.
</p>

<p>
So bottom line always remember that you are walking on thin ice
and it is easy to get out of track. Keep faith and stay solid on
good values.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)">Whiplash</a> (2014):
</p>

<p>
This is a movie that I watched on some plane when traveling
somewhere. Looking at the date it went out, it was probably during my first
travel to the United States when I visited the west coast.
</p>

<p>
Strange animal the memory. Out of the blue. In 2022 during my solo
travel - after sailing, at the time of Grenada when I had quite some spare time -
I had suddenly to watch this movie again. So this says a lot about
the power of this movie and how much it sticks around inside a
person. 
</p>

<p>
So turning to a brief comment of it as usual. 
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. Clear plot and lots of tension. 
</p>

<p>
The general question that remains open at the end is the
following: 
</p>

<p>
Is Fletcher behaviour justifiable? Does it makes sense the way he
thinks and behaves? 
</p>

<p>
And on the top of it - is Neiman intelligent? Or let's rather use
a more appropriate word instead of the much abused <i>intelligent</i>
one: <i>stable</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Is Neiman stable enough to be with a character like Fletcher? Does
Fletcher have enough empathy to set the proper limits when pursuing
his story-line?
</p>

<p>
I think this is the correct line of reasoning. I personally like
people that push. I try to push myself. So essentially I do not
condemn Fletcher idea. But I also believe in emotional
intelligence and that humans have to be <i>good</i> 
to the core. None of this was shown by Fletcher. This is the
<i>tragedy</i> of the movie. A <i>fragile</i> kid in the hands of a person
just focused in the pursuit of his goal that does not take the human
side into account. 
</p>

<p>
I also like to read the comment on youtube to see what people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY-Ytrw2co">think</a>. Very interesting the debate around the final. Is it a
tragedy? Is it a victory? 
</p>

<p>
People even start to talk about hedonism. Much fun to see the
philosopher come out.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RI0QvaGoiI">Notting Hill</a> (1999):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. With the magic British touch. I think that even more
interesting than the classical love story of the movie is the
friendship among the librarian's group of friends.
</p>

<p>
It was so sincere with that British humor. I think that this is
one of the greatest strength of the brits people. They are not
picky and can see tragedies with different lenses.
</p>

<p>
I would sign a paper to be able to make such jokes and laugh with
my dearest friends when life will make me feel miserable. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTfYsODWQo">Stand by me</a> (1986):
</p>

<p>
I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was
twelve. Jesus, does anyone?
</p>

<p>
Good sentence as an end of the movie. Movie telling a simple
story. No big surprises. But still good. This is what simple
stories telling a piece of every child life can achieve. There is
no message but still the story is powerful. And the end makes the
message in the end, with a sentence - at the end. Nice movie.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GzCG6lpFUw&amp;t=57s">Vacanze Romane</a> (1953):
</p>

<p>
Was nice to see such an old movie. The story is outdated as in
2020 no one would ever come up with such a story. These were
rather fights from a previous generation.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe I guess that in some countries you would still have such
a story, what is different however is how the movie would be
interpreted. It would be more scenographic today, the message
would be more aggressive, more direct. 
</p>

<p>
This is a thing that I think got lost with respect to older
movies. They were more elegant and romantic. I do not know if it
was due to the fact that there was a different way to live the
public dimension in that age. They were different and this
difference emerges when watching such an old movie.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of my grand-dad, he used to have some of this
gentleman demeanor that is a leitmotiv in the movie. It got lost,
for better or for worse, replaced by a young wilder generation.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_His_Father">Brief an den Vater</a> (Franz Kafka):
</p>

<p>
So this is a great piece. I liked it better in comparison to the
Trial.
</p>

<p>
You note how sharp the mind of Franz is here. When you read a
book of him it is always about a thrid party. There might be
something in it but there is always a certain degree of
detachment in it.
</p>

<p>
When people write something that is that personal it is
different. You immediately notice and get all of the struggles
and uncertainties of the person when reading the letters.
</p>

<p>
You immediately feel how difficult it must be to rise up next to
such invasive personalities. On the other hand you see how much
of the sorrow is caused in wanting to satisfy such
personalities. You need to kill the figure so to say in order to
fully be free and make your road in your life. You have to get
rid from the chains so to say.
</p>

<p>
Anyways that is pretty much it. I must also refer to the part
where he talks about the jewish religion. Was smiling a lot when
listening to it, experienced much of it on my skin and I must say
that he put it down in a wonderful way. I think that in this
sense he is missing still the bigger picture that you just get
when you get more into it but I must say that if you experience
jewishness in a very mild and superficial way as many secular
jews do, than the feeling is exactly that one. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial">The Trial</a> (Franz Kafka):
</p>

<p>
Difficult book. I found it quite slow and heavy at times. I guess
this is necessary in order to deliver the message of the book and
give us this feeling of oppression that Josef K. is living.
</p>

<p>
I get it but, <i>oh boy what a book</i>. Did not expect something as
this from one of the most acclaimed books of a well known author
as Kafka.
</p>

<p>
Now turning to the book, it is a great piece of book in the
end. I mean not the lightest, not the most pleasant to read but
it surely gives you something.
</p>

<p>
The entire book you are waiting for something to
happen. Something that would give sense to all of the
book. Something that will eventually make cristal clear what is
happening.
</p>

<p>
This does not eventually come.
</p>

<p>
I think this is a bit the message of the book. You see Josef who
is a bright thinker. And you see how he does not manage to get
out of his troublesome situation, getting ultimately acquainted
to the trial to the point where he starts thinking of guilt.
</p>

<p>
To the point where his energies are gone. To the point where he
ruins himself. To the point where the mechanic of an
incomprehensible machine of the world defeats him.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you do not end in a similar way. You are experiencing
yourself these very mechanism that Kafka talks about. It is not a
trial but the mechanism of the trial are very well present in our
everyday life. So how to manage to break out from them and the
non-sense? To break out from the inertia.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Nights_(short_story)">White Nights</a> (Fyodor Dostoevsky):
</p>

<p>
Nice, short and juicy.
</p>

<p>
I guess that this is the reason why Dostoevsky entered the
Olympus of the Russian literature. You are just transported into
the narration.
</p>

<p>
The fact that all of the book is narrated in first person helps
you to really feel as being there, as being the person.
</p>

<p>
I mean it is different to the books that I usually read. Usually
I like to read books that leave you with some new insight. With
some new concept to think about, with something new.
</p>

<p>
This is not that kind of book.
</p>

<p>
It is just a book telling a simple story that lets you feel the
emotions of the character narrating his story.
</p>

<p>
It is emotions that everyone already experienced at least one in
his life such that it is easy to get the message.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I liked it but yeah nothing to say more than
it. Just a nice story to read and get transported into.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Israel-Concise-History-Nation-Reborn/dp/0062368745">Israel - A Concise History of a Nation Reborn</a> (Daniel Gordis):
</p>

<p>
So very nice book. Nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
It delivers what it promises in its title.
</p>

<p>
Well written, easy to follow and it gives a great overview of all
the difficulties the young state had to go through.
</p>

<p>
Its dilemmas. Its most defining events.
</p>

<p>
Its tragedies and internal conflicts.
</p>

<p>
The difficult decisions that ought to be made.
</p>

<p>
The character of the nation.
</p>

<p>
Very recommended book in order to better understand the history
of the country. Gives you quite some picture and it is easy to
follow as well structured as opposed for instance to the
biography of Ben Gurion.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Jonathan-Netanyahu-Commander-Entebbe/dp/9652292672">Letters of Jonathan Netanyahu</a> (Johnathan Netanyahu):
</p>

<p>
What to say. Possibly the greatest book I have ever read. 
</p>

<p>
Many books try to push our mindset in one direction or the
other. Make us do some required bit of philosophy or enlarge our
knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
This is different. It elevates the spirit in all of us. It is
simply a collection of letters that were not even meant to be
published. 
</p>

<p>
They tell the story of a man. A great man. That reminds us how
important it is to have purpose in life. 
</p>

<p>
The thing that strikes most about him is the degree of
emotional intelligence and of lateral view. On the top of it
impossible not to stress how he was focused on the essential
things in life. Mundane topics were far from him. A man with
something to tell. A man with a purpose.
</p>

<p>
A raw model for every one of us. Thank you for having been Jonathan.

<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno,_nessuno_e_centomila">Uno, Nessuno, Centomila</a> (Luigi Pirandello):
</p>

<p>
Very beautiful book. Read it during the quarantine. The time I
cought covid and had to stay by myself for 10 days.
</p>

<p>
I must say this is not the best book to read during the
qurantine. This due to its disruptive message. You might question
too much when being confronted with such a big topic staying all
alone in your house.
</p>

<p>
The message is beautiful. It touches one the vanity of the
human. It touches the mechnics of life. And how a person that
refuses the cerimony we are all bounded to live in is declared as
a madman.
</p>

<p>
I especially liked the chapter on the nature. Where he escapes in
the countryside and starts to make a critique to modern cities and
societies. Very deep and very true. Refer to it <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/book-wisdom/">here</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/confine-del-futuro-dellintelligenza-artificiale-ebook/dp/B07P5TVJVB">Il Confine del Futuro</a> (Francesca Rossi):
</p>

<p>
So particular book. If you want to go in the nitty-gritty of the
topic that is not the right book for you. It is quite high-level
and this is the reason why it has average reviews on Amazon.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I partly agree with the people. On the one hand,
you can clearly see that the author did not go the extra mile in
writing the book but simply leveraged the name, the position, and
the buzz for the topic for selling the book. In this sense there
is a bit too much of auto-reference that when not backed by
interesting content might hurt some reader. That was proved by the
Amazon reviews, nobody likes ego-centric people.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, you might appreciate that is so high
level. After all the author already excuses at the beginning for
it and tells the public that is interested in the specifics of the
subject to search for handbooks somewhere else. I can understand
it, that is the ultimate difference between a <i>textbook</i> and a
<i>book</i>. Moreover, I think that there is value even in a
non-obsessed and 100%-effort book or writing. After all, in such a
way it is possible to write quick and dirty content going to the
gist of the problem without loosing too much time on petty
details. Of course you should have the skills to do that but I
think that the author has the authority to do that.
</p>

<p>
In this sense I think that the author manages well to bring some
<i>meta-level</i> thinking when talking about AI and machine
learning. This is typical of italian people, we are platonic by
education.
</p>

<p>
When thinking in these terms, I think that it is possible to say
that it is a good book - it manages well to reach what a textbook
cannot get - a high level, non-complicated, overview of the topic.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, I found of particular interest in the book the
following elements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the difference between slow and fast thinking.
</p>

<p>
I like that differentiation and I never thought about it in such
an explicit way. <a href="https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/ID28756725.html">There is a book</a> that goes over it - probably I
should read it nextish.
</p>

<p>
That is a very nice concept that I immediately applied to the
book when reading it. It is kind of interesting how all of the
concepts expressed in the book are nothing new to anyone working
or dealing with AI/machine learning/applied
statistics.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we get acquainted about all of that common
knowledge as a side effect of doing some work; i.e. we get it in
the fast way of thinking without making it ever explicit. While
in contrast when you read a 100-pages book expressing all of
that common knowledge you are forced to start your slow thinking
process about the topics. Even more when writing a post about it
later then. This activates an entire different way of thinking
about it and it raises new consciousness.
</p></li>

<li><p>
the macro-level differentiation between machine-learning
(learning by example) and the procedural learning (learning by
fix-rule).
</p>

<p>
I think that this differentiation is of particular importance
even if the line gets sometimes blurry when you think about
it. After all everything is a set of instructions - a procedural
learning - and it is not always as easy the difference. You
might well think of machine learning algorithms as being
deterministic, as a well specified set of rules apply to them.
</p>

<p>
This is also where I think that the general public confusion
occurs when talking about black-box.
</p>

<p>
A black-box simply occurs when the algorithm is applied to some
microlevel (say the pixel level), the human is not able to make
sense of. When human are not able to make sense of the input and
how it is transformed as we do not find any connection or simple
storytelling for it, we start to talk about black-box. After all
I never heard anyone talking about black-box for a regression
although the mathematical ultimate concept between the
"black-box neural networks" and regressions is not that far.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you talk about black-box when the information extracted out
of an object is of no practical use for a human being as we are
not able to make sense of it at any level as we cannot read and
interpret that piece of information.
</p>

<p>
That is the ultimate strength of learning by example and the
reason for the buzz around machine learning. You allow to
extract information out of an entire new set of objects, which a
human being is not able to make any sense of.
</p>

<p>
This is the beauty of machine learning and why it is creating so
much buzz. Not the single individual algorithm. Nor a complex
mathematical formula in itself. This is an idea that a <i>book</i>
can bring you but a <i>textbook</i> cannot - or at least not in the
same way as you need a stronger prolonged stimulus to think in
these term and get out of that micro-level thinking you do in
your routine when applying such things.
</p>

<p>
The issue of these black-box models is then that the human has
to go by trial and error to learn these patterns. We have to try
to analyze some microlevel entity and see how it works. You have
then reached the ultimate pure-black-box level so prone to
overfitting.
</p>

<p>
Finger-crossed: you have no idea of why a result occurred but
you just hope and make some mathematical tricks that should
convince you that your results are generalizable and adversarial
resistant.
</p></li>

<li><p>
about the impossibility to distinguish between procedural
learning and learning by example.
</p>

<p>
interesting is that the meta-level that allows a human to get
the idea of an object, is not known to the human in a procedural
way. Also interesting is that it is not an example driven
deducted idea.
</p>

<p>
You are able to think in abstract terms - say a yellow hydra
with the face of a dog - vs <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1nGGpfIgXevFXMyR_JFnghK9lAoUeAXeq1u6D8y-k8arlRarloNdoLz4SFyLE-79neRo&amp;usqp=CAU">by example</a>.
</p>

<p>
Or you can get the idea of quadruple out of a cat. This in
contrast to the case of machine learning where in order to learn
the idea of quadruple you would have to re-index and retrain all
of your data and train again a different algorithm for the
task.. you cannot also ask ML to make a generalization out of a
category as it has no idea on how to do that.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is in this sense to see and think about how we human
are not even conscious ourselves about some structures of our
thinking and decision making. We are black-boxes and this is the
ultimate reason why we need psychologists to remember us such a
thing and tell us that it is okey.
</p>

<p>
However, funny is also the way we cannot accept a black-box
object, pretending that each and every human decision is
motivated by pure rational choices. Note that this tendency is
not just in machine learning but it is pretty much installed in
the human brain of any western person as a core and fundamental
fix-point value. 
</p>

<p>
Well, I see that I am starting to go too much into philosophical
discussion. That is dangerous so I will let it and go back to my
micro-level thinking.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Before_Us">The Life Before Us</a> (Romain Gary):
</p>

<p>
Nice book. I read it in 10 days but I was rather busy. It is the
book from which the movie - la vita davanti a se - originates. See
above your impressions.
</p>

<p>
If the movie made a good impression and was <i>strong</i>; well the
book is at another level. I loved it. The strength of Momo is
powered to the <i>nth</i>. It is the most beautiful thing: the fact
that despite all of the bad things that can happen in life, when a
heart is good, love will win. No compromises, like Momo always
did, very conscious of his misfortune. It is probably that
consciousness that made bearable the unbearable and forged a
character as strong and pure as the one of Momo. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/State-Any-Cost-David-Ben-Gurion/dp/0374112649">A state at any Cost: The Life of David Ben-Gurion</a> (Tom Segev):
</p>

<p>
Well I must say that I agree with the reviews I have read about
the book: not well written.
</p>

<p>
I think that Segev could have been more thoughtful and could
invested more time in organizing his very big research material
and structure a bit more the book. It is way too long, the
language and the way it is written not very engaging. I think that
a common thread is sometimes missing.
</p>

<p>
Despite of all of that, there is interesting things in the
book. First of all the character of Ben-Gurion. What a beautiful
character. Here Segev managed quite well to report the picture of
the battled David character, albeit I think he took some liberty
and biased a little bit the book at times in one direction or the
other.
</p>

<p>
In any case wonderful and charismatic person Ben-Gurion. It is
kind of heart warming reading about the struggles of such a great
person. You see once again that even people that managed great
things in life faced quite some lows and difficulties often
doubting of themselves.
</p>

<p>
Important is to see how in the end no matter how hard he fell -
especially in his youth - he managed to reach his goals. As it is
framed in the book - not because he was an outlier or
high-performer individual but rather because he had a very strong
life purpose and was highly committed to it. Make the plan
explicit and the rest will follow. I must admit that in
comparison to Ben-Gurion I do not have a fix-point or north star
that reaches in any level the one of him. I guess because at the
end I like to take pleasure from small things. But I would like
to fulfill myself in some dimension apart from the general family
affection. Will still have to work on that.
</p>

<p>
In any case going back to Ben-Gurion, one thing that I
particularly like is that he was eating books. He had a curious
mind and it was impressive the amount of interest he could
multi-manage and the amount of books he read. I still remember
when I visited his house - which is now a museum in Tel-Aviv. So
many books. Crazy. In this sense you are improving in time. Of
course you are not at the level but there is some Momentum, which
I hope you will improve in time.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, I loved the fact that he was holding a
diary. He was obsessed in organizing his thoughts by putting
things in writing. I love it and I must say that here again I am
improving through this Blog. It is a very good exercise and it
helps as well to organize a bit better my life.
</p>

<p>
And then yeah, what to say. It was good refresher of the history
of Israel and what the land means to the Jewish people. What it
cost and how many troubling moments and decisions where on its
way. In this sense, I must say, there is better literature but it
is fine as that was in fact not the purpose of the book.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Is_a_Man">If this is a Man</a> (Primo Levi):
</p>

<p>
It is a couple of years since I read this book. I read a few
others in the meanwhile but I want to write a few notes on
this. Even if notes are not fresh in my memory, what stroke me the
most of this book was its content.
</p>

<p>
I expected some very hash statement. Some deep philosophical
questions. I expected to find all of that and more in the book. I
was surprised. All of that kind of material is left just in the
title of the book. One sentence: <i>if this is a man</i>. Without
answer nor a question mark.
</p>

<p>
That is the power of the book. It is true to itself. It is the
true, naked message. It is the history of what such people had to
live through in concentration camps.
</p>

<p>
It talks about routine. It talks about how the people that
survived managed the routine; just manage the routine with little
escamotage. That is the daily life of all of us. Manage it at the
microlevel conscious about a bigger picture but without giving it
too much importance.
</p>

<p>
And the book follows that pattern. It does not talk at the
macro-level the complete folly of the Nazis. It talks at the
micro-level of the horrible experience of the people.
</p>

<p>
And it leaves the exercise of making sense of it, if at all
possible, to you with that single title: <i>if this is a man</i>.

</p>

<p>
Was nice being in broadway. Nice show. Well done. I must admit
that it was difficult at times for me to follow entirely the
script. I mean I could well follow the broad plot and always
understand most of it. But not 100%. This due to the musical
component of it that was not always easy to follow for a
non-native English speaker like me. 
</p>

<p>
I remember that when I first watched the movie of it during my
high-school time I was much more struck by the character of
phantom and especially the end. It was much more of a struggle. I
cannot understand how much this was missing in the show due to the
point mentioned above and how much it was inherent in the design
of the show.
</p>

<p>
In any case nice to be in Broadway and to watch a Broadway classic
was ultimately the goal such that I was very satisfied with it.

</p>

<p>
The first part it is extremely nice. Very funny and at the same
time very true.
</p>

<p>
It talks about the life of all of us. The natural leitmotiv of our
societies. How each and everyone of us follows in that bit and how
in a funny way we become funny caricatures of societies schemas.
</p>

<p>
The second part is a little bit random.. still funny at times. But
it looses that part of reality that was in the first bit. In the
first part the story is of the public. I.e. the actors in play
represent each and everyone of us. I.e. in their story there is as
well <i>our</i> story. In the second part that relation bit
disappears. It becomes <i>their</i> story.
</p>

<p>
The message at the end is nice. It tells you <b>not</b> to enter in
that rabbit hole as Luciano did. To renounce - in order to keep
your integrity.
