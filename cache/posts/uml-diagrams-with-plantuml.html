<p>
For my first bigger project I had to construct a flow diagram
describing the architecture of a back-end model analytics model I am
working on. 
</p>

<p>
This post briefly discuss on UML and gives the set-up of <code>Plantuml</code> on
emacs.

<h2 id="org00f711c">Why UML?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org00f711c">
<p>
I recalled the notion of UML I studied a couple of years ago in a
compulsory course of business informatics. At the time my eyes were
all about macroeconomics and the few classes I had on it deeply annoyed
me. A more dry material was difficult to imagine.
</p>

<p>
Now, with time, shifting my interests towards CS, and getting involved
in more complex projects I am starting to appreciate the importance of
working in a structured way, documenting the most. Furthermore, I am
starting to understand the importance of working with modular
architectures and the importance of OOP. A lot of progress have to be
done in both as I never was a particularly organized person but I
decided it is time to start to get my head around it.
</p>

<p>
I read online and I understood the wide spread usage of UML
diagrams. Especially interesting was the notion of <code>Round-trip
Engineering</code> with <code>code-generators</code> and <code>reverse engineering</code>, two
topics I aim to go back at some point.
</p>

<p>
In any case I started to play around with <code>plantuml</code> for a project I
am working on and I am actually both enjoying and appreciating working
with it, the next section introduces the  set up of it.

<div id="outline-container-org1790244" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1790244">Set up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1790244">
<p>
In order for you to work with <code>Plantuml</code> on emacs the first thing you
have to do is to install <code>graphiz</code> as some plantuml generated images
leverages it.
</p>

<p>
On MAC OSX this can be done by running in  your  shell
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot; &lt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null
$ brew install graphviz
</pre></div>

<p>
Secondly you have to download the java <code>.jar</code> file running
<code>plantuml</code>. This can be done at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download">following link</a>. Once downloaded I
moved the <code>.jar</code> file into the <code>.emacs.d</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
Once this is done you have to add the jar file to your org mode
configuration (there is a variable already set for it)
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-plantuml-jar-path</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">expand-file-name</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/.emacs.d/plantuml.jar&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Finally you simple have to add <code>plantuml</code> as a language for your
babel configuaration
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-babel-do-load-languages</span>
 <span class="ss">&#39;org-babel-load-languages</span>
 <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">plantuml</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can furthermore check for the successful configuration of the
installed <code>graphviz</code> module by running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> @startuml
 testdot
 @enduml
</pre></div>

<p>
This should display an image with the installed graphviz version.
</p>

<p>
You are now ready to go. A minimal example can now be for an activity
diagram taken for very good <a href="https://plantuml.com/">official plantuml webpage</a>.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@startuml
(*) --&gt; &quot;Initialization&quot;

if &quot;Some Test&quot; then
  --&gt;[true] &quot;Some Activity&quot;
  --&gt; &quot;Another activity&quot;
  -right-&gt; (*)
else
  -&gt;[false] &quot;Something else&quot;
  --&gt;[Ending process] (*)
endif

@enduml
</pre></div>

<p>
Many other interesting options such as creating mind-maps with org-mode
syntax exists.
