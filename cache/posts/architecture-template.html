<p>
So this is a brief post containing my template for working on IT
systems design.
</p>

<p>
I use it when working on projects as a way to keep the system under
control through time and to have a general overview of them.
</p>

<p>
On the top it is good to align the general stakeholders involved in
the system on the general status and direction for the system.
