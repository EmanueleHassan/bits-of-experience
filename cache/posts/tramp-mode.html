This is possibly not even a post. Rather a quick entry but I like my
blog with the different tags to find the material quickly.

<p>
I started recently using tramp mode to ssh into some Raspberry devices
as I got some <i>TJbots</i> to play with. This post contains a very short
intro on how to use tramp.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
I was aware that with tramp mode you could simply ssh into a file and
edit it from your local device, no <i>nano</i> or such horrible programs
needed. Moreover you keep your IoT device thin as you don't have to
install any special software on it.
</p>

<p>
However, I was missing a proper shell on it. It turned out that if you
start an <code>eshell</code> while being sshed into a file on your IoT device
via tramp mode you will have your wonderful <code>eshell</code> written
completely in emacs and customizable according to your needs, with all
of the nice auto-completition on the top of it. 
</p>

<p>
There seems to be some overhead, as sometimes it reacts sluggishly
however this is hardly noticeable and a great way to work on remote
devices to my mind.
</p>

<p>
To tramp into a remote machine use the following syntax
</p>

<p>
<code>C-x C-f</code>
</p>

<p>
and enter
</p>

<pre class="example">
/method:host:filename
/method:user@host:filename
/method:user@host#port:filename
</pre>

<p>
Important is again to underline that you have first to ssh into a file
and then from there you can launch a terminal.
