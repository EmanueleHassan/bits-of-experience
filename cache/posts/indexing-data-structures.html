<p>
While going deeper into data stores and HBase I got interested in the
indexing mechanism on which the database rely for an optimal
read/write performance. 
</p>

<p>
I watched some videos that I put on this post. The first one gives a
very good overview of Block Storage and the effectiveness of
multi-indexing putting at the end the focus on B-trees and B+-trees. 
</p>

<p>
The second one briefly goes Bloom Filters, it is not as good as the
first but it makes the point for Bloom Filter without going too much
in the nitty-gritty. These are very interesting data structure that is
widely used in different fields - from fraud detection to check
whether a transaction is unlikely to have been performed by the legal
owner; to databases for skipping a query all-together if the bloom
filter gives negative output (see for instance in Hbase where a query
given the size of the table might be especially expensive) etc. 
</p>

<p>
The third does not discuss any data structure and assumes on top of it
that you are comfortable with the topic of log structured tree and
merge-sort algorithms. It goes in to the research field and analyzes
possible optimizations for write intensive key-value stores, which as
seen in the Big Data class are by now possibly one of the most
important store class.
