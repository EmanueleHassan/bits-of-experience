<h2 id="orgf9a5997">Necessary Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf9a5997">
<p>
For this demo you need to have an IBM Cloud working account. You can
subscribe under <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/login">this link</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you have your Cloud Account up and running you need to activate
the following two services.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Watson Assistant</li>

<li>Watson Discovery</li>
</ul>

<p>
After that it is possible to enter the <code>WatsonAssistant</code> Service,
launch the Watson Assistant and create a new assistant. 
</p>

<p>
This will be an empty box to the stage. The content continues as
follows:
</p>

<p>
First, I will show how to integrate the assistant in the HTML of the
client you might wish to showcase the product. 
</p>

<p>
Secondly, I will show on how to manually create a simple dialog on the
assistant. 
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, I will show the integration with Watson Discovery - a powerful
and unique product unique to the IBM offer as no other major cloud
provider offers a similar service. 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I will briefly discuss on the potential of integrating the
Assistant with your business specific content data through Salesforce,
Databases or third party applications.
</p>

<h2 id="orgfd5a242">How to integrate the assistant into a HTML page</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd5a242">
<p>
If you want to showcase your assistant to a client it will be useful
to embed it into the client page.
</p>

<p>
In order to do that you have to download the client webpage, activate
the web chat integration and embed the javascript source code
referring to your watson assistant service.  
</p>

<p>
Notice, that the Web Chat Integration will also able to connect the
Web Chat to a service desk solution so your assistant can transfer
users to live agents.
</p>

<p>
The steps are summed up in the following video:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgefe23b6">
<p>
Nice! You have now integrated your assistant to the client webpage. It
is time now to add content to your assistant.
</p>

<p>
In order to do that you have first to create a new skill to your
assistant as follows.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/videos/Bildschirmvideo%20aufnehmen%202020-04-16%20um%2015.25.53.mov">Click me if the video below does not load.</a>

<p>
It is important when creating the skill that you specify the language
you want to use in your application as some training and built-in help
functions will refer to that.
</p>

<p>
Once that is done you will be ready to create your mock dialog.
</p>

<br>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org25a5775" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org25a5775">Creating Intents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org25a5775">
<p>
For the official documentation, please refer to the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents">following webpage</a>.
</p>

<p>
Intents are general categories that Watson Assistant
recognizes. These are important as when you will subsequently create
a dialog, the assistant will reply to the customer based on intents
it recognizes from the customer demand.
</p>

<p>
For instance you can create an intent that recognizes that a client
wants to block a credit card. You would have then to enter five-ten
phrases that characterize such instance.
</p>

<p>
In the below picture an example of an Intent
<code>#kreditkarte_blockieren</code> I created with the few examples I gave the
service.
</p>

<img src="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/images/Bildschirmfoto 2020-04-16 um 17.33.14.png" alt="kredit" class="center">

<br>
<br>

<p>
I created another intent <code>#assertive_answers</code> that will be used later
in the demo.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is to see how the assistant manages to pretty well
generalize to examples that were not used in the training as visible
in the video below.
</p>

<p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
Recall always to test the trained dialog in order to see if the
provided samples were nicely generalized by Watson.

<h3 id="orgd6982be">Defining Entities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd6982be">
<p>
Entities can also be used when creating a dialog. This represent as
the name suggest specific entities such as time, number, dates,
street addresses, geolocations; you name it.
</p>

<p>
Some entities are already avaiable out of the Box in Watson
Assistant. Some other have to be trained. 
</p>

<p>
You can further explore them under the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities">following link</a>. For this
basic tutorial we will use pre-trained entities. Important is to
activate them as shown in the picture below.

<h3 id="org60bbfcc">Create a Dialog with Child Nodes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60bbfcc">
<p>
Once you have the necessary requirements for creating a dialog, you
can create the following as in the video below. 
</p>

<p>
This video leverages the previously created <code>#blocking_card</code> intent
as well as the out-of-the-box available banking intents provided by
watson in the content catalog. Finally it leverages a second
created class <code>#assertive_answers</code>.
</p>

<p>
It uses then child nodes that checks whether the answer to the
chatbot is mapped to some intent or entity and according to that it
continues the dialog.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e02721">
<p>
Notice that while the above example illustrates the intents and entity
creation you can add multiple in one shot uploading csv files of up to
10MB. You can furthermore leverage a richer setting of capabilities
working directly with the API instead of working through the IBM GUI.

<h2 id="orgc902123">Integrate your Assistant with your Business Databases and Watson Discovery</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc902123">
<p>
Nice, you have a first mini-example of Watson Assistant running on a
client Webpage. 
</p>

<p>
The question that you might ask yourself and that your client is
likely to ask you too is how to speed up the process of creating and
customizing your Assistant Dialog. 
</p>

<p>
If you might well create a few standard dialogs to deal with the most
common requests, you might desire to set up a flexible solution.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, Watson Assistant does not act as a stand-alone product but is
rather intended to act and live in symbiosis to the rich set of Watson
and non-Watson API out there. 
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the context the <a href="https://medium.com/ibm-watson/integrate-watson-assistant-with-just-about-anything-695bc1d29875">following post</a> might be
useful. There you find the following great schema of the intended
broader architecture for your Watson Assistant.

<p>
As the connection to client databases and client specific contents
must be discussed directly with them, I will next focus on the Watson
Discovery Service integration. 
</p>

<p>
Just a quick insight before. The idea for the client content
integration is the one of integrating web-hooks in your Assistant.
These will point to your Business Application Endpoint and will make
the Endpoint returned payloads available. 
</p>

<p>
A further integration in the Watson Assistant is the one of the
disambiguation option in order for the Assistant to request further
clarifications to the user before deciding on the desired action plan.
</p>

<p>
Finally notice, that the above is just the tip of the iceberg. You
might even fine-tune and train the correct classification of intents
in your Assitant and much more.

<h3 id="org081923a">Creating Watson Discovery and Create a Web Crawl</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org081923a">
<p>
This section, briefly outlines the integration of the Watson Assistant
with the Watson Discovery Service. Recall again that this is not
intended to be an exhaustive guide but rather just to give a glimpse
in the possibilities of such service.
</p>

<p>
Watson Discovery is a powerful service that allows to launch
web-crawls and extract information from HTML pages. The idea is for
the user to specify root HTML pages of interest and to specify the
amount of hops (the number of related pages) that the service is
allowed to visit from each root page.
</p>

<p>
The Discovery Service, will then start to extract relevant information
from the pages. The nice feature is that it will not simply extract
plain text embedded in HTML tags but it will rather also download all
the PDFs embedded in the pages. 
</p>

<p>
In such a way you can for instance incorporate Blogs or News articles
related to your company/institution/entity of interest.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it will allow to integrate important information outlined in
PDFs and HTML pages of your client webpage. Your Assistant will then
be able to feed them to the user and refer him to the specific content
page.
</p>

<p>
Notice that due to fancy <code>dynamic webpages</code> and javascript code
integrations the HTML content extraction might not be 100% functional
out of the box. Do not despair. An IT specialist might always be able
to filter the content and tags that the crawl will extract and
process. Such adjustments do not work through the IBM cloud GUI and
will require some adjustments by passing <code>.json</code> files with the
desired configurations via API.
</p>

<p>
Finally, notice that the content extracted via Watson Discovery might
be further enriched and pre-processed by leveraging Natural Language
Understanding Services, Watson Knowledge Studio as well as Smart
Document Understanding - another neat product shipped with Discovery.

<h3 id="org0e4c14c">A quick Demo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e4c14c">
<p>
This video demonstrates a very quick demo for the Watson Discovery
Integration with an Assistant for the case of the Zürich Kantonalbank. 
</p>

<p>
This will let you experience a very rough integration and will let you
understand its strength at best.
