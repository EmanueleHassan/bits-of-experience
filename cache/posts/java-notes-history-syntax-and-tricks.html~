<p>
Java should become my major programming lanaguage in the next
years. The goal is to get proficient at in a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
I think it is a good thing cause as a programmer the fact that I was
never was exposed to Java was in fact a pity. Many of the most
interesting software of 21st century is written in Java (think of
Hadoop stack, Kafka &amp; Co.). While coming from the world of data
science I see the point for python I must say that once you have
extremely wide productive systems it might very well make sense to use
a more structured language as Java. Plus you should get up to speed
the functional language possibilities of Java available from Java 8
on. I think that this might boost even more the Java lanaguage and
make it a strong candidate for python-alike workflows.
</p>

<p>
That said let's go. Enjoy this new ride and absorb the language.
</p>

<p>
Note that all of the notes about the general syntax of the language
come from "Java the complete reference - 7th edition (Herbert
Schildt)" publicly available on the world wide web at <a href="https://gfgc.kar.nic.in/sirmv-science/GenericDocHandler/138-a2973dc6-c024-4d81-be6d-5c3344f232ce.pdf">this url</a>.
