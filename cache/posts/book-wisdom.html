<blockquote>
<p>
Heroes are not supermen; they are good men who embody - by the cast
of destiny - the virtue of their people in a great hour.
</p>

<p>
(Herman Wouk - Intro to the Letters)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
This book is for them, as much for anybody; a word from their
renowned fallen peer, to reassure them that their hard long training
is needed, that love of the country is noble, that self-sacrifice is
rewarding, that to be ready to fight for freedom fills a man with a
sense of worth like nothing else.
</p>

<p>
(Herman Wouk - Intro to the Letters)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The trouble with the youth here is that their lives are meager in
content, drifting as though in a dream or a game.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's clear to me that there are people who find their lives
complete, altogether flawless, although they lack a purpose and a
future.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The only thing people talk about is cars and girls. Life revolves
around one subject - sex. I think Freud would have found very
fertile soil here. Bit by bit I'm becoming convinced I'm living
among apes and not human beings. 
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I must feel certain that not only at the moment of my death shall I
be able to account for the time I have lived; I ought to be ready at
every moment of my life to confront myself and say - This is what
I've done.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the striking fact, that such thoughts were written when he was
17 or something like that. You can understand the caliber of the
person by it. I was one of that people at this age. The thing is
that I was scared at this time. I was not really believing 100% in
myself and I was lacking purpose. Make sure that you will not have
your children enter this state of mind.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Life consists of countless experiences and is measured from
innumerable points of view. But the things I did, I did with utter
sincerity, and devoted all my strength to their accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If I err and make mistakes, I'll start again and build anew.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Learning is important above all else. The desire to study and
acquire knowledge, to solve problems, to read and understand - these
are the things that make a man great. At the same time you have to
get along with the society in which you live - with your friends and
most of all with Father and Mother.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing his brother Iddo at the begin of his Zahal training)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It seems that I can stand anything except this state of ignorance,
this dependence on the decisions and utterances of someone else; and
this is precisely the condition in which I now find myself.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing his Family on his decision of rejecting the air-force)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Man's strength lies in his ability to adapt himself to new
conditions and to reconcile himself to them. Needless to say,
everything depends on you - on your state of mind, on your successes
and failures both in Zahal and in life in general. Isn't that so?
You have to try to find the positive of the service, in the army as
a whole, and use it to its fullest.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing to Tutti - Sept 18, 1964 - beginning of Zahal)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The main thing is not to try to evade anything and to want to
overcome.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing to Iddo - Sept 28, 1964 - beginning of Zahal)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For if you want to extract all that is useful from the service in
the way that seems right to me, you have to follow the most
difficult road. And this is without doubt the most difficult.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan choosing the paratroopers  - March 26, 1965 - beginning of Zahal)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
You are marching on the right path and anyone who does that and who
looks ahead cannot help but reach his goal.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing to Iddo  - Oct 5, 1965 - beginning of Zahal)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the army I have learned to appreciate the beauty of life, the
immense pleasure of sleep, the taste of water, which is
irreplaceable, the matchless value of will power, and the marvels a
man can do if only he will.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing to the family - Oct 23 1965 - beginning of Zahal)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps you don't really understand the importance of doing what you
are engaged in at the <i>present</i> in the best possible manner. And if
you do understand this, as your actions and your successes indicate,
then how on earth can you belittle your activities in this way?
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan writing to Bibi as he was feeling his studies were not a
great achievement - December 22 1965 - in Zahal paratroopers)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The below is important as young people often lack the understanding
of what their superiors are doing. This also happens very often in
the office. Often due to some lack of communication.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Time does not crawl; on the contrary, it sprints. You don't have a
chance even to reflect on the meaning of those seconds. Time is just
one great chunk.
</p>

<p>
In the past, when I was just an ordinary soldier, I thought I was
going through the greatest difficulty. Now as an officer, I see how
wrong I was.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Family - March 15 1966 - Zahal officer training)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I once thought an officer could get more rest than an ordinary
soldier, but I could not have been more wrong. During drills I am
with them through each of all those long hours, and all that time
the work keeps me continually on edge. The burden of worry and
responsibility leaves its mark, and I feel the full weight of
command resting on my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Family - March 15 1966 - Zahal officer training)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Impossible!" This is the slogan of despair to which everyone
clings. And since it's "impossible", they let themselves do
nothing. To hold one's own in such an atmosphere is therefore a
serious challenge.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
As you know, when I decide to do something, I devote myself
completely to the matter at hand and cannot do anything else, since
I have to do things perfectly. It's not a matter of principle or
calculated decision, it's simply the way I am.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Family - March 23 1967 - Finished Officer time. Stayed
in Israel to understand what it is to work and challenge himself in
harsh economic Israeli crises)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most interesting phenomena that I observe in the course
of my work is what I call "the gold rush". When a man begins to
earn money, he wants more and more and finds it terribly hard to
disengage himself from what looks like a gold mine. 
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Family - March 23 1967 - Finished Officer time. Stayed
in Israel to understand what it is to work and challenge himself in
harsh economic Israeli crises)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The last few years taught me not to "fight windmills", unless I
really felt I could match myself against them. I do all that is
required of me completely and to the best of my ability, but when
I've finished doing it's over and done with.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Family - March 23 1967 - Finished Officer time. Stayed

harsh economic Israeli crises)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now that I am in Israel, I realize how much I missed that part of
myself whose origin and place is in Israel. When I was in America, I
missed it and I knew that my place was here, but not until I got
back did I know how right I was.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Father when moving to Boston to study at Harvard - July
22, 1968)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Only if we do that, if we give all we have for the well-being of our
country, will Israel remain the State of the Jews. Only then will
they not write in the history books that once indeed the Jews roused
themselves to action and held on to their land for two decades, but
then were overwhelmed and became once more homeless wanderers.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Father when moving to Boston to study at Harvard - July
22, 1968)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
On me, on us, the young men of Israel, rests the duty of keeping our
country safe. This is a heavy responsibility, which matures us
early. It seems that the young Israeli belongs to a special breed of
men. It's hard to explain this, but it can be felt. 
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
What unites them produces a feeling of brotherhood, of mutual
responsibility, a recognition of the value of man and his life, a
strong and sincere desire for peace, a readiness to stand in the
breach, and much more.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
As regards the latest incidents, I really must praise the Jewish
people of Israel. The cool-headedness, the lack of hysteria, the
immediate control of every situation, are really surprising. You
don't find here the raging mob quality that is rather typical of
hard times. This is a special people and it is good to belong to
it. 
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan telling the parents about his intention to return to the
army - March 17, 1969)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't worry too much. Things will work out. Don't forget: strength,
justice and staunch resolution are on our side, and that is a great
deal.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to parents after Yom Kippur war - November 17, 1973)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I believe that in every generation people fall back on the
past. It's not because the past was more peaceful, more serene, but
because time glasses, so that everything looks rosy and doesn't hurt
the eyes.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Bruria - when slowly falling in love again after the
harsh experience with Tutti - November 11, 1974)
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>
Anyone who believes there is another purpose is welcome to it - the
main thing is not to live aimlessly. Those who have nothing to hold
on to are always discontented, always find idols for themselves and
always abandon them for new ones. They are lucky in having an idol
when they do, and unlucky in not "having long-term satisfaction" -
something that idols cannot provide. 
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Bruria - when slowly falling in love again after the
 harsh experience with Tutti - November 11, 1974)
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>
And you know as well as I do that there can be good days and bad,
full or empty, and the only thing that can change our momentary
state of mind is our <i>general</i> state of mind, which guides us
through life. 
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
Enthusiasm and imagination soaring to the skies are gods of youth,
and I want to believe that in you they are eternal. I want to
believe it, first, because youth becomes you; second, because if you
should ever lose them, your sense of loss will be unbearable, and I,
who love you so, will grieve with you.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
I don't regret the crossroads I've passed. Once past the crossing,
I'm on my own way. And if there is more beauty, more flowers along
the road I didn't take, I still don't regret it, because it wasn't
my road. My path will pass through fertile fields and lovely
gardens, and over mountains and rocks and even deserts, but in all
its twists it will be one path - known and yet mysterious. Our life
is a world unto itself within many others. -
for the roads are numberless. Some intersect while others pass
through planes that will never touch. And all the roads are traveled
by people, and sometimes they meet at the crossroads, and sometimes
continue together, and sometimes part again and sometimes not. And
it isn't just a matter of direction but of time as well. And why be
so interested in other planes when we can hardly master our own?
</p>

<p>

falling in love again after the harsh experience with Tutti -

There is an ever-widening skills gap between what schools are teaching

On the part about the nature - <a href="https://annamariaromanello.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/uno-nessuno-e-centomila-di-luigi-pirandello-libro-secondo/">source</a> (unfortunately I was
listening to the audiobook and could not make notes).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dopo aver mostrato che l’uomo può costruire una casa, una città, ci
mostra che può aver bisogno di cercare la pace in campagna, dove la
pace esiste perché usciamo dal mondo che noi stessi abbiamo costruito:
un mondo fatto di case, di chiese e di piazze; un mondo costruito
dall’uomo e costruito” perchè non ci si vive più così per vivere, come
le piante, senza saper di vivere; bensì per qualche cosa che non c’è e
che vi mettiamo noi; per qualche cosa che dia senso e valore alla
vita; un senso, un valore che qua, almeno in parte, riuscite a
perdere, o di cui riconoscete l’affliggente vanità.” Moscarda sembra
desiderare di non aver più coscienza d’esser, come una pietra, come
una pianta!  L’uomo sa come si forma una nuvola che ignora la sua
esistenza ed è sola; ma sa l’uomo spiegare il perchè dei perchè?
Moscarda ricorda la fatica dell’ uomo; la sua pochezza di fronte
l’infinito; ricorda la vanità dei nostri affanni e mostra il contrasto
tra il volo di un semplice uccellino, che vola con ” un frullo e un
trillo” e quello dell’uomo che si alza da terra con un ” motore
strepitoso e puzzolente e la morte avanti.” Il nostro protagonista
alza la sua invettiva contro il mondo finto e meccanico” un altro
mondo nel mondo” , un mondo che ha senso e valore soltanto per l’uomo
che ne è l’artefice: Pirandello ci indica che la caduta dei valori del
suo tempo può portare alla pazzia; può portare al vaneggiare di
Moscarda che immagina di rientrare dalla campagna, camminando lungo il
Corso di Porta Vecchia, dove gli alberi, ” probabilmente”, non pensano
e le bestie non ragionano. Se potessero pensare… Chissà cosa
penserebbero degli uomini che, per godere della loro ombra, li
piantano in città. Forse… Che cosa stavano a fare lì, in mezzo a tanta
gente affaccendata! Orecchie non ne hanno, ma, forse, per crescere
hanno bisogno di silenzio, quel silenzio che c’è nella Piazzetta
dell’Olivelli, ove la terra ogni anno ne approfitta, perché crede che
lì non ci sia la città e che gli uomini se ne siano andati. Quindi,
l’erba cresce, ma per poco perchè lì, invece, è ancora città per cui
giungono gli spazzini a tagliarla, con grande meraviglia degli
uccellini che si chiedono la ragione della presenza di quegli spazzini
e scappano; non lo possono fare, invece, le bestie che tirano il carro
e, forse, tutte le creature, diverse dall’uomo, hanno un senso per sè
che l’uomo non può intendere: ci sarebbe bisogno di una maggiore
intesa tra l’ uomo e le altre creature che sembra si divertano a
mandare all’aria tutte le costruzioni umane con cicloni e
terremoti. Tuttavia, l’uomo ricostruisce, obbedendo a qualcosa,” che
non si sa cosa sia”, e trasforma la materia a modo suo, considerando
materia anche se stesso: perciò si ricostruisce come ricostruisce la
casa ed ognuno si ricostruisce in una forma che gli altri non gli
riconoscono, come ciascuno di noi non riconosce la forma con cui si
ricostruiscono gli altri; ” e la stessa cosa non è uguale per tuttie
anche per ciascuno di noi che può di continuo cangiare, e difatti
cangia di continuo e l’unica realtà è la forma momentanea che
riusciamo a dare a noi stessi, agli altri e alle cose:”la realtà di
tutti diventa quella che gli altri ci danno, ma si tratta di una
realtà valida per gli altri, non per noi: e ciò varrebbe per
tutti. Gli uomini si costruiscono come costruiscono le case, finché
dura la nostra volontà e i nostri sentimenti; quando volontà e
sentimenti vengono a mancare, ci accorgiamo delle nostre illusioni.
