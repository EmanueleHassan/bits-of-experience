leaders need most in their staff. They spoke with fifteen hundred
leaders in eighty countries.
</p>

generating new ideas</i>.

<p>
They found these qualities lacking in many otherwise highly qualified
graduates.

Unsurprisingly, as Yong Zhao points out, there is an inverse

<p>
I said earlier than to transform any situation you need three forms of
understanding: a critique of the way things are, a vision of how they
should be, and a theory of change for how to move from one to the
other.

<p>
Quickly, though, humans demonstrate a power that sets us apart from
all other creatures: the power of symbolic thought, of which language
is the most obvious example.
</p>

<p>
In at least one fundamental respect, human beings are different from
the rest of life on earth: we do not live in the world directly, as
other species seem to do. Instead, we see it through frameworks of
ideas and values.
