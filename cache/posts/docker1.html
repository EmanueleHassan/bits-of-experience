<p>
The basic idea of Docker is to allow the possibility to save all of
the configuration of an application in one single image. This should
be considered as a safe environment that once properly set up can be
easily shared among different teams and once images are instantiated
all of the different teams can be sure to operate and leverage the
right configuration for running their application.
</p>

<p>
A simple and straight forward overview about the advantage of Docker
might be found in this sense at <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker_architecture.htm">docker architecture</a>.
</p>

<p>
To sum up before starting the basic idea is to create images and to
create containers based on that, which will run then the application
as defined in the docker image.

Lifecycle: build, ship, run. -&gt; build ur application. Wrap it up in a
container and ship it. Run it and scale it then. This allows portability.

<p>
With virtual machine u leverage hypervisors that runs virtual
machines. It is what virtualizes resources and makes them sharable.
Up on the virtualized resources you build then ur different OS and
specify all of the middleware necessary to run your application.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to that with docker, u have a single host OS. Hypervisors
are misssing and so OS is built on top of them. Notice moreover that
docker does not require the entire Linux OS but rather simply its
kernel. Important is moreover to notice that all the containers share
the linux kernel here. 
</p>

<p>
Docker tries to share resources. This means that if a layer is already
running for an application a second application will leverage the
instance of this exact lower layer and will ultimately save resources.
