<p>
I was told a story once.
</p>

<p>
It is about the way Da Vinci used to draw. Well I will expose it in
this post and how it is related to architectural patterns.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-org0a7e913" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0a7e913">On da Vinci drawing strategy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a7e913">
<p>
Well I do not know if that is true, but I was once told that da Vinci
could see a person for a couple of seconds and he was then able to
draw a picture of him/her.
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is that da Vinci worked through patterns. He
defined a set of noses, ears, lips etc.
</p>

<p>
Something similar to this:
</p>

<img src="../../images/daVinciNoses.png" class="center">

<p>
When he was looking at a person he could then make a quick mapping to
the different types in his set and draw the person.
</p>

<p>
The idea is now to do the same for IT architectures. You have to be
able to think in patterns and combine them.
</p>

<p>
So the idea is to check a piece of software or have a conversation
about a technical solution and map it to one of the existing patterns
in your set.
</p>

<p>
You will be able to easily abstract and get the general picture in
such a way.

<h2 id="org47445ad">Architectural Patterns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org47445ad">
<p>
I found this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/10-common-software-architectural-patterns-in-a-nutshell-a0b47a1e9013">patterns here</a>. Note that the application of such
patterns is very bounded by different domains. You even can embedd
one into the other at different abstract levels. 
</p>

<p>
So it is not that the patterns are constantly in competition with
each other. They are often complementary and act on different
levels. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5976626" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5976626">Layered Patterns</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5976626">
<p>
This is the most classical pattern. Here each layer is responsible
and implements part of the solution.
</p>

<p>
Each layer operates on the layer below it and it is abstracted from
the entire logic of the layers below.
</p>

<p>
One of the most classic examples of such an architecture is how the
networks operate. You recall there: physical, data, network,
transport, presentation.
</p>

<p>
Another classical layered architecture that was used very much in
IT in the past is the following:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1014966" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1014966">3-Layer</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1014966">
<p>
This is composed of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>presentation layer: be it web-browser, app etc.</li>

<li><p>
application layer: in this tier, information collected in the
presentation tier is processed. It acts as the middle layer
between the data layer and the presentation layer.
</p>

<p>
The presentation layer should never directly access the data
layer and is abstracted from it.
</p></li>

<li>data layer: this is the persistence layer, where you store the
data etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>




<div id="outline-container-org94aa766" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org94aa766">MVC Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94aa766">
<p>
You can read more about these patterns <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">here</a>.

<div id="outline-container-org108bf16" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org108bf16">On Model 2 Architecture, Servlets and JSP</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org108bf16">
<p>
So basically this is one of the standard architectures for Java to
communicate with clients and serve content from web-servers.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2021-10-21 110909.png" class="center">

<p>
Basically this is one of the standards. You have your servlet that
handles the server side communication. It instantiate a Java Bean
that is responsible of fetching the information from the database.
</p>

<p>
Finally the information is rendered via JSP - which are a high-level
abstraction of Java servlets. They allow Java code and certain
predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup content,
such as HTML. The resulting page is compiled and executed on the
server to deliver a document.
</p>

<p>
The architecture is a <code>model-view-controller</code> architecture. The
<code>view</code> is the JSP, the <code>controller</code> is the Servlet and the <code>model</code>
is given by JavaBeans.
</p>

<p>
This was never your bread and butter but this is what you were also
doing at the end in your Flask project. There you could as well
embedd dynamic information in your html pages. I never went into the
details of it as I was busy running the project. But that should
have been the JSP equivalent.

<div id="outline-container-orgc1b2310" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc1b2310">Difference Layered and MVC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc1b2310">
<p>
So note that MVC is a pattern very specific to front-end and
front-end frameworks.
</p>

<p>
Note the follwoing entry from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10739914/what-is-the-difference-between-3-tier-architecture-and-a-mvc">here</a> that makes as well the point:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At first glance, the three tiers may seem similar to the
model-view-controller (MVC) concept; however, topologically they
are different. A fundamental rule in a three tier architecture is
the client tier never communicates directly with the data tier; in
a three-tier model all communication must pass through the middle
tier. Conceptually the three-tier architecture is linear. However,
the [model-view-controller] MVC architecture is triangular: the
view sends updates to the controller, the controller updates the
model, and the view gets updated directly from the model.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So this is a true difference among the two. In any case, thinking
in structures it is clear that the main difference lies in the fact
that the two are fundamentally different, i.e. the Layered
architecture is used across the enterprise application.
</p>

<p>
The MVC pattern is used specifically for the front-end.

<div id="outline-container-orge34ef44" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge34ef44">Broker Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge34ef44">
<p>
This is the most classical stuff with queues, pub/subscribe,
streams etc.
</p>

<p>
Typical software is: Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ and
JBoss Messaging.
</p>

<p>
You have as well a tons of specialized solutions for it in the
cloud.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org53c88a5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org53c88a5">Event Bus Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53c88a5">
<p>
This is in the spirit of the broker pattern. In fact it is the
implementation of one or multiple brokers to implement the <b>bus</b> of
choice that connects the events across applications.
</p>

<p>
You can read of 4 different ways to do that in <a href="https://medium.com/elixirlabs/event-bus-implementation-s-d2854a9fafd5">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is an important concept as many companies have very fragmented
applications that need to communicate with each other.
</p>

<p>
This is the usual architectural pattern through which they try to
get to the goal. Often it fails due to the complexity of connecting
multiple applications operating at very different logical levels
with different technologies involved. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orga905186" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga905186">Peer To Peer Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga905186">
<p>
This is the typical meshes used in file-sharing applications - like
emule etc.- , blockchain and Co.
</p>

<p>
As there is no central authority you can rely on, the key mechanism
these protocols works on is game theory.
</p>

<p>
If you fail the game-theory component of it you are screwed.
</p>

<p>
This is in sharp contrast with the classical client-server
architecture.
</p>

<p>
Note that you can use the broker pattern both with this p2p as well
in the case of client-server architectures.

<div id="outline-container-org08fb1bb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org08fb1bb">Pipe-Filter Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org08fb1bb">
<p>
This is the most classical architecture in machine layer.
</p>

<p>
This is what you do when you create the relevant pipelines.
</p>

<p>
It is at the core of the application layer and much used in data
engineering as well.

This is extensively used in databases. Check at your notes of
Hadoop.

That was especially useful. There the entire master-slave
architecture is core and you have multiple notes explaining it at
the logic level.
