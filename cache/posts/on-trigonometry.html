<p>
This is another of these topics that I always study and forget. 
</p>

<p>
But it is quite basics stuff and it pops up continuously so it is
better for you to get to know it properly and well fix it into your
brain.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb895d68">
<p>
Is everywhere. It is the origin of pi as well as the way you tackle
trigonometry and as well the way you can think of phi.
</p>

<p>
It is beautiful, smooth and female in nature. 
</p>

<p>
Always keep the circle in mind when approaching things. 
</p>

<p>
Recall the properties of the circle:
</p>

<p>
Recall what that essentially mean.
</p>

<p>
A square represented by the radius fits around 3.14&#x2026; times the
circle.
</p>

<p>
The diameter of the circle fits around 6.28&#x2026; the circumference of
the circle.

<h2 id="orgcf4f64c">The unit circle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf4f64c">
<p>
Now consider the unit circle. 
</p>

<p>
This has 3.14&#x2026; area and 2*3.14&#x2026; circumfernece. Interesting
property. Logically counter-intuitive. I guess this is the reason
why so many people struggle with math. At times, it looks as if
mathematicians are fooling around you. 
</p>

<p>
In order to understand how the two measure relate you can do the
following:
</p>

<p>
Which makes logical sense as it is the way of going from circle to
square. If you think a moment about the integration ranges.
</p>

<p>
But then you go:
</p>

<p>
Such counter-intuitive things are everywhere when you start to
think too much. I discovered in time the beauty of them and to
laugh at them and at yourself when you think too much.
</p>

<p>
In any case this is interesting. The circle and the square. That
duality that you have to deeply explore as you learned from the
book. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways, you see that pi is everywhere here. Isn't it beautiful?
</p>

<p>
We will now explore trigonometric functions of the angle at the
unit circle. 
</p>

<p>
Trigonometric functions are <b>real functions</b> which relate an angle
of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. 
</p>

<p>
In the specific given an angle you compute the ratios of the length
of two sides.
</p>

<p>
In the specific:

<p>
So you see that the tan is simply <code>sin/cos</code>.

<h2 id="org5f60d6c">Sin and Cos</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f60d6c">
<p>
You already defined the thing above.
</p>

<p>
Understand now that by taking the unit circle as a case (you can
generalize this to any circle given the fact that the circle
properties are shared across the circle class) - you can easily
see:
</p>

<p>
If you work with the right triangle in the unit circle it will be
easy to image values of the sin and cos functions.
</p>

<p>
You can then easily see that the entire pattern is defined within
the angle described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> 0 - 2pi. 
</p>

<p>
It is then easy to see the basic values at optima points 0, pi/2,
3/2 pi, 2 pi.
</p>

<p>
Just recall then the following property: <code>f' (sin) = cos</code> and <code>f'
   (cos) = -sin</code>.
