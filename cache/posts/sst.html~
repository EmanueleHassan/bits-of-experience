<p>
So time to learn a bit of SST and the concepts in this dimension.
</p>

<p>
As I am running the thing it will make sense to have a broad
understanding of the thing.
</p>

<p>
It will give as well an understanding of some terms that you see going
around.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
It will give you some conceptual understanding of some inputs that are
feeded into the system. It will give a bit of understand on how
certain things run.
</p>

<p>
Some concepts as RBC are tighlty related to it etc.
</p>

<p>
So basically I gathered a bit of sources:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.finma.ch/FinmaArchiv/bpv/download/e/WhitePaperSST_en.pdf">whitepaper of FINMA</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.actuaries.org/CTTEES_SOLV/documents/Stockholm_Keller.pdf">more compressed info</a></li>

<li><img src="/c:/C:/Users/marco.hassan/Downloads/12-4PP-summary_swiss_solvency.pdf" alt="more compressed info in plain text"/>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now the task is simply to put the info together but before a clear
high level understanding about SST.
</p>

<p>
That is regulatory capital. You also have to make some Solvency II
calculations but leave it on the side for now as you can eat simple
one piece of the cake at the time.
</p>

<p>
Understand in any case the difference of EC and RC.
</p>

<div class="container"> 
  <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8lrpWp6MJs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen;> </iframe>
</div>

<p>
At the end you can simply take it as two different constraints that
you as a business have to fulfill. It is a simple:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="sb">\[</span><span class="nb"> Min. Capital that will impose your constrains </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb"> min </span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">RC, EC</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">  </span><span class="s">\]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
\[ Min. Capital that will impose your constrains = min (RC, EC)  \]
</p>

<p>
I guess that here comes the science in the investment part as well.
</p>

<p>
When you invest you have to think about how a thing impacts the
both. This is why you make the optimization at group level and then
you propagate and implement.

<h2 id="org5781c09">Motivation and origin of SST</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5781c09">
<p>
The financial stability of several insurers has been shaken in the
past few years. Events which have had significant adverse effects
include the <i>crash in the equity markets</i> in 2001 and 2002, the steady
fall in bond yields as well as the impact of increased longevity.
</p>

<p>
For some insurers, the effects of the fall in the equity markets
have been compounded by deteriorating technical results and large
catastrophe claims.
</p>

<p>
This is actually what happened in the Swiss insurance market back in
2001 and why everything crashed drammatically.
</p>

<p>
You can get an idea by reading the <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:638f00a0-71b9-4d8e-a960-dddaf9ba57cb/150_history_of_insurance.pdf">following paper</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The size and complexity of losses would force companies but also
society at large to think differently about risk. Although the stock
markets remained reasonably robust in the aftermath of 9/11, the
attack brought the global economy to a grinding halt, due to
uncertainty of the effect on stocks worldwide. 
</p>

<p>
Insurers had to contend with unstable financial markets during this
volatile period
</p>

<p>
The insurance industry shouldered much of the economic
burden. Insurers paid an estimated USD 23.8 billion, making 9/11 the
most costly insured man-made disaster ever – and, at the time, the
second most expensive insured loss after Hurricane Andrew. 
</p>

<p>
Assessing the insured loss was a highly complex undertaking; large
claims were filed for a number of seemingly unrelated risks including
aviation, property, liability lines, business interruption and life
insurance. Losses and potential exposures were not confined to New
York, either – airlines were grounded, restrictive security measures
were implemented and events were cancelled around the world.
</p>

<p>
Some insurers, and European reinsurers in particular, embarked on an
accelerated programme to strengthen their risk management, governance,
and asset management. They fortified their systems to manage
accumulations of risk and liabilities in their asset portfolios and
developed the first economic models.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So basically this is what brought to a change in the regulation
environment for the insurance sector.
</p>

<p>
The result was:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
While there are many strands to these changes, they all have common
themes: more appropriate assessment of the specific risks companies
are running using an improved and comprehensive financial reporting
framework, standardization of approaches between countries and
industries where sensible, and improved transparency and
comparability.
</p>

<h2 id="org5494766">SST Core Principle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5494766">
<blockquote>
<p>
The proposal, which is described in more detail in later sections of
this document, can be summarized as protecting insurance customers by
ensuring that each insurance company has sufficient capital available.
</p>

<p>
‘Sufficient’ means that even in an unlikely situation (e.g.  one with
a probability of 1%), there is (on average) enough capital to allow
the assets and liabilities of the company to be transferred to a third
party. There must then still be sufficient assets to cover the
liability and the future capital costs of that third party.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0c23712" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0c23712">Consistent Valuation of Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c23712">
<p>
This risk-based supervision aims to take all financial and insurance
risks into account, especially asset and liability risks. The system
will focus on explicitly measuring risks and minimizing systemic
risk via transparency.
</p>

<p>
This is in fact the first requisit for a transparent and comparable
regime:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
assets and liabilities must be valued in a consistent way by each
company.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This leads to the concept of <b>economic vs. accounting
information</b>. So you see that is worth reading such papers. You are
finally able to put all of these concepts flying around in your data
into a coherent frame.
</p>

<p>
The necessity for the translation is that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Companies, investors and regulators have long struggled with
interpreting accounting information where assets and liabilities are
valued on different bases.
</p>

<p>
The inconsistencies can cause artificial volatility in free capital.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So SST aims to bring a little bit of order in this sense:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The SST is based on “market-consistent valuation” of both assets and
liabilities. This is described in more detail in later sections, but
essentially it means that assets are valued at their price in the
market, while guaranteed liabilities are valued based on the price
that financial markets would place on these liabilities, taking into
account all embedded options and financial guarantees.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="org013d887">On Internal vs. Standard Models</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org013d887">
<p>
Since risk profiles of the supervised insurers can be very
heterogeneous, a regulatory model capturing correctly the risk
situation of each company would be very complex.
</p>

<p>
For the SST, simpler models were developed which have to be adapted
by each company to fit its specific risk profile, thereby also
making companies responsible for target capital calculation.
</p>

<p>
While a standard model is being developed to ensure that all
companies can implement a minimum standard, the SST encourages
companies to develop internal models.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Companies can deviate from the standard models, parameters
etc. with the permission of the regulator.
</p>

<p>
This permission is granted if a company can show that its internal
model better reflects the risk situation than the standard model.
