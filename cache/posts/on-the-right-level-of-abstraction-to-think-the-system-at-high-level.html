This is as well another important component; it originates from <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/mappings/">here</a>.

<p>
I very much like these notes as they allow you to gain that high
level overview of the subject and high level understanding of the
thing.
</p>

<p>
You can then think under these terms when checking at the thing and
you can correctly understand the operation you are doing when
working on the system.

This is of paramount importance and is very core to the way you
implement your system.
</p>

<p>
The essential idea is the following:
</p>

<p>
When performing your calculations you rarely directly specify a
conditional distribution for the value of your portfolio. This is
hardly feasible due to the complexity of financial markets.
</p>

<p>
What you essentially do is express your portfolio value as a linear
combination of the underlying instruments composing it.
</p>

<p>
\[ P_{i = 1} = w * S] \]
</p>


<p>
Note that <i>w</i> is essentially a map from the instruments to the
portfolio value.
</p>

<p>
What you then generally do is not to model the conditional
distribution of the instruments <code>S</code>, but you rather specify
conditional distribution of the risk factors <code>R</code> and specify a map
from them to the instruments.
</p>

<p>
You will have then a general way of expressing your risks by the
concatenation of maps. The problem would then be more less the
following:

<p>
In the sense that:

<p>
Finally, the entire process would look at high level as follows:
</p>

<p>
So that is it. You have essentially to understand which of piece
of your system fits in which box but you can reduce everything to
that.
</p>

<p>
I could already map the components I know to this scema. Would be
cool to map everything to it once I have a clearer understanding
of the system.

The above is quite general. You can think then about how the
system you are working on handles the thing.
</p>

<p>
In general understand the following for the different component
that you have to specify in the system.
