This is as well another important component; it originates from <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/mappings/">here</a>.

<p>
I very much like these notes as they allow you to gain that high
level overview of the subject and high level understanding of the
thing.
</p>

<p>
You can then think under these terms when checking at the thing and
you can correctly understand the operation you are doing when
working on the system.

<p>
This is of paramount importance and is very core to the way you
implement your system.
</p>

<p>
The essential idea is the following:
</p>

<p>
When performing your calculations you rarely directly specify a
conditional distribution for the value of your portfolio. This is
hardly feasible due to the complexity of financial markets.
</p>

<p>
What you essentially do is express your portfolio value as a linear
combination of the underlying instruments composing it.
</p>

<p>
\[ P_{i = 1} = w * S] \]
</p>


<p>
Note that <i>w</i> is essentially a map from the instruments to the
portfolio value.
</p>

<p>
What you then generally do is not to model the conditional
distribution of the instruments <code>S</code>, but you rather specify
conditional distribution of the risk factors <code>R</code> and specify a map
from them to the instruments.
</p>

<p>
You will have then a general way of expressing your risks by the
concatenation of maps. The problem would then be more less the
following:
</p>

<p>
In the sense that:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 132850.png" class="center">

<p>
Finally, the entire process would look at high level as follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 132955.png" class="center">

<p>
So that is it. You have essentially to understand which of piece
of your system fits in which box but you can reduce everything to
that.
</p>

<p>
I could already map the components I know to this schema. Would be
cool to map everything to it once I have a clearer understanding
of the system.
</p>

<p>
Understand as well the transformation component in the above. The
idea is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>given your map from risk factors to portfolio values you compute
the value at risk. Either by some analytical formula given the
distribution of interest or via some numerical technique as
monte carlo.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That component is actually the transformation piece of the cake,
so essentially here the difficulty is on combining the conditional
distribution of R and the mapping function &theta; in order to
compute your VaR measure.

<p>
The above is quite general. You can think then about how the
system you are working on handles the thing.
</p>

<p>
In general understand the following for the different component
that you have to specify in the system.

You undestand well now what our model library is..

<h2 id="org78fb843">Remappings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org78fb843">
<p>
So basically you talk about remapping when you approximate a
mapping through a second one.
</p>

<p>
So the reasons for applying such remappings are the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-16 120131.png" class="center">

<p>
An example for such nested monte carlo simulations is the one where
actually pricing your instruments requires monte carlo simulations,
think for instance at exotic options where the price path is
important and not simply the final state.
</p>

<p>
In such a case you might want to go with remappings in order to
reduce the complexity of the operations.
</p>

<p>
That said you basically have three types of remapping. These you
already saw extensively when going into your models. These are:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-16 131014.png" class="center">

<p>
So again when working on the thing understand what kind of
remapping you are performing and always set the things into frames.
</p>

<p>
The book then treats three major sources of remappings
</p>

<h3 id="org24abce2">Holdings Remappings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org24abce2">
<p>
This is one of the typical examples of remappings where you
approximate stuff therefore managing complexity at the expense of
loosing a bit of precision.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/holdings-remappings/">the following</a>:
</p>

<p>
So we do not use this kind of exercise in the first step of the
system, maybe later. Not sure about that. 
</p>

<p>
Keep an eye on this as well.

<h3 id="orgb8466bd">Function Remappings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8466bd">
<p>
These are the standard things. You saw tons of them in your first
masters and that is the most interesting part from the
mathematical part.

<p>
These are based on the structural underpinnings of the
markets. Have to understand well your instruments in order to
properly deal with them.
</p>

<p>
A very cool example for all of this is <a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/modeling-curves/">the following</a>. Exactly this
step was causing issues as some recent point. So you see, read and
you will find the answers. Everything is already out there. You
just have to go and collect.
</p>

<p>
So understand all of these babies in the system.

Also nice was to have a read on chapter 12. It sets a high level
overview for implementing the system and how to construct
everything. Important design decisions etc.
