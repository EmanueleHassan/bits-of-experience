<h2 id="org9d4da97">Difference with permission-less Blockchain in a Nutshell</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9d4da97">
<p>
Hyperledger Fabric registers the identity of the different entities
operating on the network through their digital certificates. This is a
key difference with permission-less blockchains where anonymization of
the stakeholder is guaranteed. 
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, policies are one of the things that make Hyperledger
Fabric different from other blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. In
the latter systems, transactions can be generated and validated by any node
in the network. In contrast, Fabric is a permissioned blockchain where
the users have the ability to decide on the governance of the network, and
change the governance of a running network. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the transactions are not visible to anyone but just to the people
that should see it for security reasons. Moreover, to verify the
transaction on the blockchain a small group of participants have to
endorse it (such as the parties involved in the transactions and maybe
a third party). This stays in contrast to the proof of work based
blockchain such as the bitcoin, which just requires the majority of
the network to endorse the transaction.

<h2 id="orgae4f0d4">Hyperledger Fabric</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgae4f0d4">
<p>
This is the backbone of IBM blockchain. A solution that can run both
on the cloud, as well as on-prem as well as in multi-cloud.
</p>

<p>
The difference with Ethereum or such other platform is that they run
on very generic protocols and you are therefore limited in your
blockchain implementation to such platform and protocols. Hyperledger
fabric is the building block that comes before, that allows you to
customize your solution and get to the best blockchain solution
according to your needs.
</p>

<p>
The idea of Hyperledger Fabric is that the completely public
blockchains that requires each and every peer to publish and validate
on it take a huge blow when it comes to scalability. Moreover
confidential data cannot be upload on the blockchain due to its public
transparent nature.
</p>

<br>

<div id="outline-container-orgb149c0b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb149c0b">The basic idea</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb149c0b">
<p>
The basic idea of the ledger is that you can have contracts between
two parties that are visible just between the two of them. This is possible due
to the modular structure of Hyperledger Fabric, which allows to create
multiple isolated channels on a single network governed by <b>distinct</b>
configuration settings. Such settings will ultimately govern the
access rights to the channel by checking the digital identity of
organizations participating in the network. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the configuration of the channels sets out the rules by
which a transaction is considered as valid and consequently appended
to the Blockchain in the usual irreversible way. Here the endorsement
policy, necessary for a transaction to fulfill the criteria to be
accepted on the blockchain, can be a channel specific and does not
have to conform to a single general protocol as in the more known
permission-less Blockchains.

<h3 id="org69e4719">Basic Components of Hyperledger Fabric</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org69e4719">
<br>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1e30b99" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1e30b99">Assets</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1e30b99">
<p>
Assets defined in Hyperledger Fabric are represented as a collection of
key-value pairs, with state changes recorded as transactions on a
Channel ledger. Assets can be represented in binary and/or JSON form. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge5ec1e1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge5ec1e1">Distributed Ledger</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge5ec1e1">
<p>
Each peers has a copy of the ledger of every Hyperledger Fabric
channel they belong to. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>world state</i> component describes <b>the state of the ledger at a given
point in time</b>. It’s the database of the ledger. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>transaction log</i> component records all transactions which have
resulted in the current value of the world state; it’s the update
history for the world state. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>ledger</i>, then, is a combination of the world state database and
the transaction log history.  
</p>

<p>
Ledger Features — The immutable, shared ledger encodes the entire
transaction history for each channel, and includes SQL-like query
capability for efficient auditing and dispute resolution. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf53f1a2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf53f1a2">Signing of Transactions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf53f1a2">
<p>
This is possibly the centerpiece of Hyperledger, allowing your
network to be come a network of identifiable organizations and
rendering such network permissioned.
</p>

<p>
Different components of the blockchain network use
<i>certificates to identify themselves</i> to each other as being from a
particular organization. 
</p>

<p>
That’s why there is usually more than one CA supporting a
blockchain network – different organizations often use different
CAs. Indeed, CAs are so important that Hyperledger Fabric provides
you with a <b>built-in one</b> (called Fabric-CA) to help you get
going. Though in practice, organizations will choose to use their
own CA.  
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc8d8e29" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc8d8e29">Channels and Privacy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc8d8e29">
<p>
Each channel has its ledger. You can say that given a channel the
principle is the same as the one of the more well known
permission-less blockchains. <b>Channels provide privacy from other
channels, and from the network</b>.  
</p>

<p>
A channel’s ledger contains a configuration block defining
policies, access control lists, and other pertinent
information. Peers dispose of an identity in the way that they are
linked to the organization they belong via certificates issued by
trusted CAs. These identities really matter because they
<i>determine the exact permissions</i> over resources and access to
information that actors have in a blockchain network.
</p>

<p>
A ledger exists in the scope of a channel — it can be shared across
the entire network (assuming every participant is operating on one
common channel) — or it can be privatized to include only a specific
set of participants. In this latter scenario, these participants would create a separate
channel and thereby isolate/segregate their transactions and
ledger. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h4 id="org1614137">On the possibility to go the half-way</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1614137">
<p>
In order to solve scenarios that want to bridge the gap
between total transparency and privacy, <i>chaincode (smart contracts) can be installed only on peers that need to access the
asset states to perform reads and writes</i> (in other words, if a chaincode is not installed on a peer,
it will not be able to properly interface with the ledger). 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgeb0183c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeb0183c">On the possibility to keep an Organization specific database</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeb0183c">
<p>
When a subset of organizations on that channel need to keep their
transaction data confidential, a private data collection
is used to segregate this data in a private database, logically
separated from the channel ledger, accessible only to the authorized
subset of organizations. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc722c7d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc722c7d">On the possibility to encrypt smart contract entries and store the encrypted value on the Blockchain</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc722c7d">
<p>
To further obfuscate the data, values within chaincode can be
<b>encrypted</b>. Once encrypted data has been written to the ledger, it
can be decrypted only by a user in possession of the corresponding key
that was used to generate the cipher text. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d62be7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0d62be7">ChainCode/Smart Contracts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0d62be7">
<p>
These are written in Golang or JavaScript. You can imagine the
substantial benefit in comparison to writing down contracts in
Solidity with all the further complexity layer consisting in
mitigating the costs of the proof-of-work and the consistent
design of <i>gas limits</i> for limiting the loss in case of errors
embedded in the contracts.
</p>

<p>
State transitions are a result of chaincode invocations
(‘transactions’) submitted by participating parties. Each transaction
results in a set of asset key-value pairs that are committed to the
ledger as creates, updates, or deletes.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org6d7f5dd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6d7f5dd">Consensus Mechanism</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d7f5dd">
<p>
Hyperledger Fabric has been designed to allow network starters to
choose a consensus mechanism that best represents the relationships
that exist between participants. As with privacy, there is a spectrum
of needs; from networks that are highly structured in their
relationships to those that are more peer-to-peer. Peers validate
transactions against endorsement policies and enforce the policies.
</p>

<p>
<i>Consensus is achieved ultimately when the order and results of a block’s transactions have met the explicit policy criteria checks</i>.  
These checks and balances take place during the lifecycle of a
transaction, and include the usage of endorsement policies to dictate
which specific members must endorse a certain transaction class, as
well as system chaincodes to ensure that these policies are enforced
and upheld. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org60439d9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org60439d9">Ordering Services</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org60439d9">
<p>
Many distributed blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, are not
permissioned, which means that any node can participate in the
consensus process, wherein transactions are ordered and bundled into
blocks. 
</p>

<p>
Because of this fact, these systems rely on probabilistic
consensus algorithms which eventually guarantee ledger consistency to
a high degree of probability, but which are still vulnerable to
divergent ledgers (also known as a ledger “fork”), where different
participants in the network have a different view of the accepted
order of transactions. 
</p>

<p>
Hyperledger Fabric works differently. It features nodes called
orderers (it’s also known as an “ordering node”) that <b>do this
transaction ordering</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Because Fabric’s design relies on deterministic
consensus algorithms, any block validated by the peer is guaranteed
to be final and correct. Ledgers cannot fork the way they do in
many other distributed and permissionless blockchain networks. 
In addition to their ordering role, orderers also maintain the list
of organizations that are allowed to create channels. 
</p>

<p>
It’s therefore helpful to think of the ordering service as the initial
administration point for the network. A configuration file acts on top
of such ordering service containing the policies that describe the
starting set of administrative capabilities for the network. 
</p>

<p>
Ordering services are usually multi-node, and can be configured to
have different nodes in different organizations.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc468191" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc468191">Multi-node ordering service.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc468191">
<p>
As the ordering service stays at the heart of the hyperledger
fabric networks and it is used to create the network initially and
connects to all channels in the network. This raises issues in a
decentralized world and it is therefore necessary to de-centralize
the ordering service by letting it being comprised of many
individual nodes owned by different organizations.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf514953" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf514953">Ordering and Consensus. The Mechanism.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf514953">
<p>
The architecture of Hyperledger Fabric factors out consensus into
its own component — the orderer service. This is an unusual
feature because it means Fabric can support different consensus
algorithms by just switching out the orderer implementation. 
</p>

<p>
One of the desirable property is Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT),
which says the orderer can do its job even in the presence of
malicious actors. 
</p>

<p>
This is apparently, still not given on Hyperledger Fabric
although much work is going into it. This is mitigated by the
fact that acting on a permissioned network you have the chance of
filtering out malicious actors from the network.
</p>

<p>
I recommend <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/blockchain/articles/blockchain-hyperledger-fabric-ordering-decentralization/">this</a> blogpost to put things in perspective. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd795a18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd795a18">Transaction flow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd795a18">
<p>
In Hyperledger Fabric the transaction flow is separated into three
steps, which may be run on different entities in the system: 
</p>

<p>
(1) executing a transaction and checking its correctness, thereby
endorsing it (corresponding to “transaction validation” in other
blockchains);
</p>

<p>
Once the transaction have been endorsed by checking at the
endorsing policy, the endorsing peers take the transaction proposal
inputs as arguments to the invoked chaincode’s function. The
chaincode is then executed against the current state database to
produce transaction results including a response value, read set,
and write set (i.e. key/value pairs representing an asset to create
or update). <i>No updates are made to the ledger at this point</i>.
</p>

<p>
(2) ordering through a consensus protocol, irrespective of transaction
semantics;
</p>

<p>
Here, the application “broadcasts” the transaction proposal and response
within a “transaction message” to the ordering service. The
transaction will contain the read/write sets, the endorsing peers
signatures and the Channel ID. The ordering service does not need
to inspect the entire content of a transaction in order to perform
its operation, it simply receives transactions from all channels in
the network, orders them chronologically by channel, and creates
blocks of transactions per channel. 
</p>

<p>
(3) transaction validation per application specific trust assumptions,
which also prevents race conditions due to concurrency.
</p>

<p>
The transactions within the block are validated to ensure
endorsement policy is fulfilled and to ensure that there have been
no changes to ledger state for read set variables since the read
set was generated by the transaction execution. 
Each peer appends the block to the channel’s chain, and for each
valid transaction the write sets are committed to current state
database. An event is emitted by each peer to notify the client
application that the transaction (invocation) has been immutably
appended to the chain.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe1c9ba" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbe1c9ba">Physical Layer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe1c9ba">
<p>
The above defined is the Logical Layer of the Blockchain Network. Once
this is defined with all of the necessary configurations, the ledger
within a channel is effectively distributed and <i>hosted</i> among peers
as in the permission-less blockchain networks.
</p>

<p>
Given the physical layer it is then possible to integrate applications
to your channel where the interaction of these and the peers is
managed by chaincode (i.e. smart contracts). In order to render this
possible a <b>chaincode package must be installed</b> on at least one peer
from the organization governing this. In such a way this will then be
able to implement the logic of the smart contract and distribute it
across the network.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3a89c6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf3a89c6">Consensus, Transaction distribution at the Physical Layer</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf3a89c6">
<p>
An organization must approve a chaincode definition in order to use
the installed smart contract to query the ledger and endorse
transactions. 
</p>

<p>
A sufficient number of organizations need to approve a chaincode
definition (A majority, by default) before the chaincode definition
can be committed to the channel and used to interact with the
channel ledger. Once the definition has been committed, the smart
contract can be invoked by client application - now and only now -.
</p>

<p>
Note that although every component on the channel can now access
the smart contract, they are not able to see its program
logic. This remains private to those nodes who have installed the
smart contract. Conceptually this means that it’s the smart
contract interface that is defined and committed to a channel, in
contrast to the smart contract implementation that is installed.
</p>

<p>
To reinforce this idea; installing a smart contract shows how we
think of it being <b>physically</b> hosted on a peer, whereas a smart
contract that has been defined on a channel shows how we consider
it <b>logically</b> hosted by the channel.
</p>

<p>
You should not think of peer nodes which do not have smart
contracts installed as being somehow inferior. It’s more the case
that peer nodes with smart contracts have a special power – to
help generate transactions. Note that all peer nodes can validate
and subsequently accept or reject transactions onto their copy of
the ledger. 
</p>

<p>
However, only peer nodes with a smart contract installed can take
part in the process of transaction endorsement which is central to
the generation of valid transactions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9d06c7d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9d06c7d">How to create a Channel</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9d06c7d">
<p>
In order to create a channel you have first to create a <i>consortium</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Why are consortia important? We can see that a consortium defines the
set of organizations in the network who share a need to transact with
one another.  
</p>

<p>
A channel is now the primary communications mechanism by which
the members of a consortium can communicate with each other.  
</p>

<p>
When creating a channel you have first to link it to an ordering
service. In the next stage of network development, you are going to connect
components such as client applications and peer nodes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Important</b> is that when creating a channel you have to create a new,
completely separate configuration for it. This will govern the extent
of the transactions within the channel.
</p>

<p>
Once a channel has been created, it is in a very real sense “free from
the network”. It is only organizations that are explicitly specified
in a channel configuration that have any control over it, from this
time forward into the future. Likewise, any updates to <i>base</i> network
configuration from this time onwards will have no direct effect on
channel configuration.
