</p>

<p>
It is tough; to acknowledge that I am a monster in some people's eyes
is not easy.
</p>

<p>
But by now; I understood the lesson: Just keep going - no feeling is final.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
I stopped writing for a bit. I stopped because I was scared. I was
told not to write anymore. That it is dangerous. After all - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GUm5g8SG4o">anything
you say can and will be used against you into court of law</a>.
</p>

<p>
But free thinking is important - too important to give up. On the top
of it I think that no one will care about words of an unemployed. It
is just words of a pirla - an italian idiot.
</p>

<p>
I understood that this blog in the past got more readers than
intended. 
</p>

<p>
It was tough to realize it. Some of you might have had fun reading it
but living the consequences, in first person, I might tell you that it
was anything but fun. You may refer to the first video for more.
</p>

<p>
Just now I am understanding the wise message of the family - Article 31.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
E ad un certo punto saranno tutti amici tuoi, diranno di amarti per
quello che sei vorranno solo privarti di un pezzo di quello che hai.
</p>

<p>
Ma ci sarà sempre la mamma - che ha gli occhi più giovani di noi.

<p>
Non importa se modelle o commesse, certe donne si faranno gioco di
te. Trattale tutte da principesse e sarai un re.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
E ad un certo punto finita la festa vedrai tutti andare via, ti
accorgerai che quel poco che resta ti basta ed ecco quella sarà casa tua.
</p>

<p>
I think that I am slowly finding home. But I still need people to
leave the party.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/nothing-to-see-here-the-evolution-of-a-catchphrase">Nothing to see here</a>: just an unemployed free thinker. You might follow
this blog or not. But I decided I will not let censorship win my
thoughts and to continue writing. It helps me to put order in my
thoughts and navigate better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmSKX5TF3g">the white noise</a> in life.
</p>

<p>
As for me; well.. I still need to recover from all of this but I hope
that I will soon be ready for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzuXZfKg2YM">part II</a>.
