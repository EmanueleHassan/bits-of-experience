<p>
I admit I was wrong and committed mistakes. 
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
So basically I did some mistakes recently. I mean nothing major.
</p>

<p>
In any case, once the milk is on the ground&#x2026;. it is on the ground,
no matter how sorry about it you are.
</p>

<p>
Important to this stage is to take your lessons out of it and focus on
the future.
</p>

<p>
And the lesson for me is: <i>do not forget to breathe</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is always the same point. The one I stuggle much dealing with.
</p>

<p>
I have warm blood and this hinders me at times to wait and be patient
and deal with situations as a surgeon and not as a houthakker.
</p>

<p>
Anyways; make sure that the lesson is learned. Keep it at the core of
your very being.
</p>

<p>
Your warm blood is your strength but it is a double-edge sword&#x2026; I
recently learned that part of it is chemistry and with age, as biological
structure of your brain changes, it should get better.
</p>

<p>
Well, monitor that change as well - with the classical boiling the
frog issue - and make sure that when that happens, experience will
compensate the loss in energies.
</p>

<p>
In any case, be mindful; improve at dominating your elements and:
<i>do not forget to breathe</i>.
</p>
