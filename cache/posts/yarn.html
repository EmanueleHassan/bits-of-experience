This post briefly introduces YARN - <b>Yet Another Resource Negotiator</b>.
It was introduced to overcome the limits of MapReduce v 1.0,
especially the idle resources component, <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/mapreduce/">discussed in the previous post</a>.

<h2 id="org222e042">Issues with MapReduce v 1.0</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org222e042">
<p>
In MapReduce 1, you had a single Master - the JobTracker - being
responsible for too many tasks. This created a bottleneck. The
responsibilities of the JobTracker involved among the rest: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the resource management scheduling; i.e. assigning
different jobs to different <b>slots*/*containers</b>
(virtualized hardware) among the machines.</li>

<li>the monitor; i.e. checking the smooth operations of the
jobs and that there was no failure.</li>

<li>job lifecycle; i.e. upon failure reschedule the jobs.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Finally, the possible greatest shortcoming of MapReduce was the
static allocation of slots. These are assigned in Mapreduce1 at
the beginning -i.e. in the <b>configuration</b> time, saving X Cores
and Y GB of memory on different machines for Reducer and Mappers
operations. It is then clear that being MapReduce a sequential
operation, the resources of the Reducers would sit idle, while the
Mappers are performing.

<h2 id="org9f39eb4">The YARN Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f39eb4">
<p>
The idea of YARN was then to reduce the amount of operations the
JobTracker was responsible for. The key idea was the one of
separating the monitoring and scheduling tasks therefore
increasing the overall performance.
</p>

<p>
The idea was therefore to elect two different Masters types. 
</p>

<p>
One - the ResourceManager - acting as the Master for the entire
cluster of machines, being responsible for connecting with the
client and scheduling the jobs. 
</p>

<p>
One - the Application Master - working on at the Node/slave level
being responsible for monitoring the jobs, negotiating the
resources needed for them with the ResourceManager.
</p>

<p>
Important, is that, in contrast to the old version, the
Application Master would now negotiate the slots for the resources
needed with the ResourceManager in a separate way for the Mapper
and Reducer operation. That is it will first ask resources for the
Mappers without reserving any slots for the Reducers. Just when
the Mappers are done it will free up the slots assigned for such
operations and ask new resources for performing the Reducer
operations. You can understand that with this new architectural
design no resources would sit idle waiting for being assigned.
