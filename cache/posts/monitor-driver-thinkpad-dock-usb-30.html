Last week I received the last piece to get up and running my ThinkPad
USB-3.0 docking station. While, the configuration worked out of the
box for windows systems, configuring the docking station with Ubuntu
OS was not straightforward.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
It turned out that the Ubuntu OS needed an installation of an external
driver in order to properly work with the docking station.
</p>

<p>
As always <i>stack-overflow</i> was a useful friend and I was manage to
find <a href="https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/615714#ubuntu">this useful link</a> outlining the necessary steps in order to
download the necessary dependencies and install the needed driver.
</p>

<p>
Once that is done your docking station should work out of the box.
</p>

<p>
You can then look at the connected monitors using the terminal command
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>xrandr -q
</pre></div>

<p>
And once you find the monitor, which you might want to change the
orientation you can run
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">## xrandr --output &lt;monitor name&gt;  --rotate &lt;direction&gt;</span>

xrandr --output DVI-I-2-2 --rotate left
</pre></div>
