<p>
So basically I am starting to leverage the correct stack in this
field.
</p>

<p>
This will help me to properly and quickly navigate the data.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
I am sorry but based on my experience there is really no game in
town.
</p>

<p>
For ETL and data analytics python is superior to Java. Maybe there
would be a discussion with Scala but to properly judge I would need to
take some time to explore.
</p>

<p>
This is left for a different moment.
</p>

<p>
That said I will keep my structure as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>use java for orchestrating your applications</li>

<li>use python for the actual ETL jobs</li>
</ul>

<p>
combine the two via APIs.
</p>

<p>
So now everything is ready, just waiting for the security piece in the
pipeline.
</p>

<p>
Moreover after the integration specified in this post you will be able
to move away from pure SQL. There is monster SQL that is developed in
my team.
</p>

<p>
There is little chance to explore these huge queries bit by bit.. I
mean too much manual copy and paste for my taste and too little slice
and dice options.
</p>

<p>
With this set-up you will be able to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>fetch data from DBs</li>

<li><p>
use SQL and/or pandas native methods to transform your data
</p>

<p>
(just think about the apply methods and the rich ways to transform
your data in comparison to pure SQL)
</p></li>

<li>explore the data programatically at development time in Python</li>

<li>insert the data into DBs</li>
</ul>

<p>
No way this is not the correct stack. Everyone that tries to talk you
out of it is clearly out of track. After all the <i>just do it</i>
mentality of this team has some pros. Nobody will be able to stop you
if you deliver.
</p>

<p>
So this post briefly touches on how to properly set up the thing and
the little things that is important to consider in order to keep
everything under control in the long run.

<h2 id="org762f3b8">SQL Alchemy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org762f3b8">
<p>
Note that this is important - with it you essentially have a
full-fledge toolkit to operate on SQL and have the possibility of
performing ORM mapping. Note that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern">similar in spirit</a> to
Hibernate so you see that despite switching languages the concepts
are very much the same across.
</p>

<p>
For me the most interesting thing of it is however the integration
with pandas. This will be the killer for me and most likely the way
I will be working in.
</p>

<p>
This rather than via ORM. Maybe I will be switch idea in time as I
will have to go in this space with Hibernate and Java in either
case and then I will be able to understand the benefits and think
if it makes sense or rather stick to a pandas approach in the
python space.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org893d44b">
<p>
In any case, that said, the first thing to understand in this
dimension is on how to create a SQL Alchemy engine in order to
work in such a way.
</p>

<p>
We are working with Microsoft SQL Servers. So here a snippet in
order to see how to work with it. In any case there are a tons of
dialects supported by sql-alchemy and should you ever work with
other relational DBs you should be able to smoothly and swiftly
change them.
</p>

<p>
Essentially I created a python snippet in order to generate
connection strings that will be passed to the <code>pyodbc</code> driver in
order to properly set up the connection.
</p>

<p>
You can see the snippet below

</pre></div>

<p>
With it you will have your engines.
</p>

<p>
You can verify that the engine is properly set up by trying to open
a connection <code>engine.connect()</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can read more about other options for setting it up <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html">here</a>. There
are as well the other dialects listed etc.
</p>

<p>
I will skip now to the pools, the other important bit of
configuration when setting up an engine together with the dialect.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5feb68e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5feb68e">Close connections</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5feb68e">
<p>
Note that despite of working with connection pools you should
still be careful in returning the connections to the pool.
</p>

<p>
Check this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8645250/how-to-close-sqlalchemy-connection-in-mysql">in this sense</a>.
</p>

<p>
So basically this is why you should work in the following way
when writing your code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>     <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">engine</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">:</span>

		    <span class="n">schema</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">conn_par</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;insert&quot;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s2">&quot;schema&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
		    <span class="n">if_exists</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">conn_par</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;insert&quot;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s2">&quot;if_exists&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Or alternatively by:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>     <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2000</span><span class="p">):</span>
	 <span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">()</span>
	 <span class="c1">#some simple data operations</span>
	 <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
When you say <code>conn.close()</code>, the connection is returned to the
connection pool within the Engine, not actually closed.
</p>

<p>
If you do want the connection to be actually closed, that is, not
pooled, disable pooling via NullPool.
</p>

<h4 id="org9eff39a">Disconnect Handling</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9eff39a">
<p>
You can read about it <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/pooling.html#connection-pool-configuration">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is not very well stated. I get that the default is the
following if you do not specify anything:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When pessimistic handling is not employed, as well as when the
database is shutdown and/or restarted in the middle of a connection’s
period of use within a transaction, the other approach to dealing with
stale / closed connections is to let SQLAlchemy handle disconnects as
they occur, at which point all connections in the pool are
invalidated, meaning they are assumed to be stale and will be
refreshed upon next checkout.
</p>

<p>
Start with it, if you get issues at some point go back there and
explore.

Python’s standard logging module is used to implement informational

immediate logging to sys.stdout for the purposes of local development;

<h3 id="orga335a26">Update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga335a26">
<p>
Note that with sql-alchemy you can essentially execute all of the
standard operations on your database.
</p>

<p>
You can use the <code>engine.execute()</code> method for it. Then the engine
will automatically ask for an available connection from the
connection pool, perform the given action and return it to the
connection pool.
</p>

<p>
Note that unfortunately there is no update statement in pandas so
that this bit is missing from the logic and the integration with
SQL-Alchemy.
</p>

<p>
So the workflow would resemble something to the following:
</p>

<p>
Extract the existing table from the db, update it in the
application logic and replace alltogether the existing table.
</p>

<p>
You can still think in pandas terms and make your transformation -
in a functional way - there in order to get your update
statements.
</p>

<p>
You can then use f-strings and similar in order to properly
construct the relevant queries.

<h2 id="orgd314544">Pandas Interaction with SQL Alchemy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd314544">
<p>
So basically that is it.
</p>

<p>
SQL Alchemy is the engine through which you would ultimately
mantain the connection to the database.
</p>

<p>
You can then leverage such engine in order to interact with the
data base in the various python modules.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance at the pandas module. This is where my interest
lies.
</p>

<p>
There you have the following methods that have to well sit into
your mind. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<code>pd.read_sql_table</code>
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>      <span class="n">DataFrame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_sql_table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">table_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">con</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">schema</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>

      <span class="n">columns</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">chunksize</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
the important parameter is the <code>con</code> parameter.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>con</code>:
</p>

<p>
SQLAlchemy connectable or str. A database URI could be
provided as str.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
So you see that you can provide an <code>engine.connection()</code> to it.
</p>

<p>
You then pass the table name you want to extract.
</p>

<p>
Important might also be the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>parse_dates</code>:</li>
</ul>

<p>
List of column names to parse as dates.
</p>

<p>
Dict of <code>{column_name: format string}</code> where format string is
strftime compatible in case of parsing string times or is one of
(D, s, ns, ms, us) in case of parsing integer timestamps.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>index_col</code>:
</p>

<p>
Column(s) to set as index
</p></li>

<li><p>
<code>coerce_float</code>:
</p>

<p>
Attempts to convert values of non-string, non-numeric objects
(like decimal.Decimal) to floating point. Can result in loss
of Precision.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
<code>df.read_sql_query</code>
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>      <span class="n">DataFrame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_sql_query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">con</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">index_col</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">coerce_float</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
Note that the arguments are pretty much the same as above.
</p>

<p>
Instead of passing a table and the corresponding schema you
actually pass a sql statement.
</p>

<p>
The other interesting argument is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>dtype</code>:
</p>

<p>
You pass the data type for data or columns. E.g. np.float64 or
{‘a’: np.float64, ‘b’: np.int32, ‘c’: ‘Int64’}.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>

<p>
This is interesting as it inserts the table into a table of
interest.
</p>

<p>
You already started using this method so you know more less the
parameters.
</p>

<p>
You have to understand the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>index</code>: set it to <b>false</b> generally. You do not want to write
the index of your pandas dataframes to the sql table generally.</li>

<li><code>dytpe</code>: same as in the above methods.</li>

<li><code>if_exists</code>: you can say - <code>{raplace, fail, append}</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

So will work quite a bit with this in memory database.
</p>

<p>
This will make it quite easy to develop and has couple of
advantages that I really like.
</p>

<p>
So here some notes to organize my thinking around it and start
properly to work in this dimension.
</p>

<p>
Might refactor then into a different separate post but for the
moment I am keeping the notes over here.
</p>

<p>
<i>Side note:</i>
</p>

<p>
Do not go too low level in here.
</p>

<p>
It is not the same database that you are actually using in your
company. I.e. the <b>dialect will be different</b>.
</p>

<p>
So in general keep it for now as a solution while they set up the
entire Dev space. On the top of it search for an in-memory mssql
instance.
</p>

<p>
So ordered as well the SQL Microsoft Express DB. You can then use
this locally once it is ready and you would have solved this big
drawback.
</p>

<p>
This is obviously a big drawback.
</p>

<p>
But I think it should not be too much of a problem. I am not a DB
person in any case and hope to cut curnors on the lower level
details of the DB by keeping all of the logic at the application
layer. The high level stuff, meaning <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>alter</code>,
<code>select</code> statements is the same everywhere.
</p>

<p>
I mean I will quickly see in time if this is a bad idea an revert
in case. It is worth to experiment at the beginning in any case in
order to find the perfect set up. This will make the difference in
the long run.

<h3 id="org3b187d8">On the issue of the main database</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b187d8">
<p>
So basically everytime you connect to a database, its name is
<code>main</code> regardless of the databse file name.
</p>

<p>
You can see the attach database option in order to attach
additional databases.

<h3 id="org3bcd7f8">On the schema</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bcd7f8">
<p>
So it seems that sqllite has no schema.
</p>

<p>
So basically you have to work without it. See <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You have just a single schema where everything goes.
</p>

<p>
You can then check at the schema of all of your tables over there
with the <code>.schema</code> option.
</p>

<p>
This might be handy when copying the data over to your other DBs.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org845f25a">
<p>
You also have to check with the data types how the situation
really is. I.e. does it always infer the data types correctly?
</p>

<p>
Can you append without big issues?
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The solution will be a trial and error case.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Have to double check properly what data types are available in
there and what you can start with it.
