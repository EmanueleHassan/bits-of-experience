So this is another post containing basic mathematical things. 
</p>

<p>
This is about combinatorics. It is all material of high school level. 
</p>

<p>
The issue is that you often make confusion and loose track of the
thing. This post is intended to summarize the knowledge such that you
can always come back at it and you will have it fresh in your memory.

So this is the most basic fact. You know it simply by intuition.
</p>

<p>
The idea is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If two operations must be performed, and if the first operation can
always be performed <i>p1</i> different ways and the second operation
can always be performed <i>p2</i> different ways, then there are <i>p1p2</i>
different ways that the two operations can be performed.

<h2 id="org92cd085">On Permutations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92cd085">
<p>
Here you deal with the specific case of ordering the possible
combinations.
</p>

<p>
You have to understand the importance difference of when the order
does matter and when it does not.
</p>

<p>
In permutations order does matter.
</p>

<p>
The following holds:
</p>

<p>
So you see that it is simply taking all of the possible
combinations in the numerator and adjusting it for the values that
can take any value without interest in the denominator.

<h2 id="org18e7189">On possible Set Combinations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18e7189">
<p>
So understand the difference between this and the permutations. 
</p>

<p>
This is key to understand when to use the binomial factor and when
to use a simple permutation counting formula.
</p>

<p>
In order to do that, understand well the following two examples and
properly think about them:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-22 151801.png" class="center">

<p>
You see in the first one you simply want to know how many different
3-letter combinations there are in a set consisting of 4
letters. You see that the simple rule 4*3*2 applies - or the
permutation counting formula.
</p>

<p>
In the second case you are not interested in the order. Such that
for you abc, and bac is the same thing. You clearly see that this
is not in the previous case when working with the permutation
formula above. 
</p>

<p>
In such a case the binomial form is used. 
</p>

<p>
For instance to count the number of <b>distinct</b> 3 letters
combinations in a 4 letter set. The formula answers the question:
choose 3 out of 4 - how many different combinations are there?
</p>

<p>
Keep this difference in mind.
