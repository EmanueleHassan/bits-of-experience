Last week I set up my working laptop and the SSH key to access my
private working github repository.
</p>

<p>
A question arise: <i>How to add an additional SSH-key to modify the
content on my public github registry?</i>
</p>

<p>
As usual a simple query to my favorite research engine solved the
issue. I refer therefore to the following blog post well outlining the
solution for the issue: <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574">multiple keys for different accounts</a>.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
The trick is rather simple. It basically consists of creating a
separate pair of ssh-keys to the one in use for connecting to your
working github account, register them on your github as in the
standard case and finally to create a configuration file in your
<code>.ssh</code> directory and specify two different Hosts associated with the
two different ssh-keys pairs. 
</p>

<p>
At this stage you are set and when dealing with github repositories
you simply have to specify, which of the two Hosts keys you intend to
use. (In case of using a default account you can even skip the
specification if you aim to use that account.)
</p>

<p>
An example might then adding a repository according to the host of choice:
</p>

<p>
<code>git remote add origin git@&lt;your chosen Host&gt;:&lt;your git file&gt;</code>
</p>
