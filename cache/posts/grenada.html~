<p>
This posts holds some memory of my time in Grenada.
</p>

<p>
First time in the Caribbean. 
</p>

<p>
Did 7 days of sailing followed by 5 days on Grenada Island. 
</p>

<p>
The sailing bit was more dynamic. The piece on the island was mainly
beach, reading and gathering of thoughts. I would like to say relaxing
but that was not it. 
</p>

<p>
It was part of my solo trip and I must admit that I am not good at
relaxing when I am by myself. I always have something on my mind and
I think I need to be around people to properly relax, which is
strange.
