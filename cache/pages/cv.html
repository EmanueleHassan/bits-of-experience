Hi, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>

I am a young professional that likes to breathe technology and be future oriented.
The goal is to work across a team that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I decided
to deviate at first from the most logical career path given my education. 

<br>
<br>

I grow up the belief that sound engineering practices make the difference 
in the real and the data world and decided at first to go down that road.

<br>
<br>

Therefore, keeping the best of my educational background, I switched
my focus towards digital processes engineering and the fast developing
data-driven industries.
