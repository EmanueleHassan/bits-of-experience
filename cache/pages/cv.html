Hi, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>

I am a young professional that likes to breathe technology and be future oriented.
The goal is to always work in a team that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and courageous ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I decided
to deviate at first from the most logical career path given my education.

<br>
<br>

Alone, pure math won't work; it has to be enriched and augmented
by sound engineering best practices, which I am developing.
I grow up the belief that just through such a partnership winning
ecosystems and winning best practices emerge.

<br>
<br>

In this sense, I eventually ended up in the space of Market
Risk Systems. I like this space as it has a non-trivial IT and
engineering component coupled with the fine mathematics the financial
industry leverages to manage its risk appetite.
I prefer, in this sense, the financial mathematics leveraged in the industry
which is highly model-based, in comparison to a more computational brute force
learning approach as often found in the AI and data science tech space. 

<br>
<br>

You might wonder - what is that exactly Market Risk Systems and
your job within the team?

<br>
<br>

As I believe it's important to have clear defined goals I wrote a
post about it. You can read it quickly <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/what-is-a-market-risk-system-self-explaination-and-goal-setting/">here</a>.
<br>
That will be your north star when working and will
pose the motivation for yourself to reach important goals and targets.
