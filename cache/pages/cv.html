Hi you, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>


<i>I believe every human is more than what he/she does so don't value me for what I do but rather for who I am.</i>


<br>
<br>

I am a young professional ready to start a career in a technological
savvy organization that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I recently decided
to abandon the idea to work in such fields due to the lack of project
oriented end-to-end work and the lack of a tangible final product and creation.

<br>
<br>

Keeping the best of my educational background I am now ready to shift
my focus towards digital processes engineering and the fast developing
data-driven industries with the hope of making soon part of an
ambitious group working towards turning revolutionary ideas into
practice for the benefit of the community as a whole.

<b>IBM</b>    <i>Junior Software Engineer Sep 2019 -</i>
</p>

<p>
60-70% Part time working student at IBM.
</p>

<p>
◦ Understood that no matter how fast you run, you will always lag
  behind. IT is fascinating and broad, too broad for a single person.
</p>

<p>
◦ Assisting the IBM Global Markets Architects Swiss team.
</p>

<p>
◦ Developing working knowledge of some Opensource technologies as well as experiencing the IBM cloud palette

  data warehouses and data lakes.
</p>

<p>
◦ Worked on a 4 month NLP PoC for a client in the public
  sector. Created a customized NLP model and deployed it on a
  web-server through the flask framework. 
</p>

<p>
Understood how in real world scenarios you might well have to
reason about the information architecture and to reason on how to
improve that to suit the analytics component or, alternatively, how to
adapt the ML model to the information architecture. It is not simply
to find and apply the most elegant and theoretical compelling ML
model.
</p>

<p>
Understood the importance of facing clients in an appropriate
way. Do some training in this sense. Facing the client in the right
way is key to successful projects.
</p>

<b>Tel-Aviv University</b>    <i>Exchange Semester Oct 2018 - Feb 2019</i>
</p>

<p>
Member of MBA class of 2018. Attended various management related courses.
</p>

<p>
Completed courses on <i>Numerical Analysis</i> and <i>Python Programming</i>
offered by the electrical engineering department as own initiative.
</p>

<p>
Completed the courses <i>Consciousness and the Electronic Mind</i> and a
course on <i>Posthumanism ..</i> - do not recall exactly the name&#x2026; was
centered about how we tend to read the world in an antropomorphic
way and how we delegate to monstruosity what we human do not like
and cannot put into this antropomorphic frame - offered by the
liberal arts department as own initiative.  At the time I did not
understand how much I could benefit from it and it was challenging
courses requiring a lot of reading so I thought it was a quite big
waste of energy. By now I smile when looking back at the times. It
teaches a lot especially once when working you are not <b>explicitly</b>
relating to humanities.
</p>

<p>
Why <i>explicitly</i>? Just a fool cannot understand that humanism is at
the very center of our world in every dimension. Even on how science
itself is interpreted and carried out.
