This Blog is an experimental trial of Summer 2019 to keep an up to date overview over my study learning encounters. 
</p>

<p>
I expect to learn much cool stuff in the next two years during my Master's study and hence I thought it might be a good idea to write some succinct posts as a way to express new learned material in a simple way via coding examples thereby facilitating understanding. On the same time this aims to be a personal future guide to refresh some content.
</p>

<p>
Notice moreover that the Blog is not simply focused around pure mathematical statistics content as I rather intend to incorporate in the latter learning from the field of Software Engineering and keep an up to date guide of <i>new</i> emacs surprises and modifications.

<p>
I hope you will enjoy the Blog and that it will be a successful ride; you can find the posts clicking the folder image on the left or following <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/index.html">this link.</a>

Let's start the ride,
