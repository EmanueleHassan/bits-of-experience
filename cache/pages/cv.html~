Hi you, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>


<i>I believe every human is more than what he/she does so don't value me for what I do but rather for who I am.</i>


<br>
<br>

I am a young professional ready to start a career in a technological
savvy organization that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I decided
to abandon the idea to start a career in the field and to deviate from 
the most logical career path given my education. 

<br>
<br>

I grow up the belief that sound engineering practices make the difference 
in the real and the data world and decided therefore to go down that road. 

<br>
<br>

Therefore, keeping the best of my educational background, I switched
my focus towards digital processes engineering and the fast developing
data-driven industries with the hope now of making soon part of an
ambitious group working towards turning revolutionary ideas into
practice for the benefit of the community as a whole.
