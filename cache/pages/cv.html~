<p>
Hi you, 
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 
</p>

<p>
I am a young -emacs addicted- professional ready to start a career in a technological savvy organization that is ready to navigate the next decades through the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.
</p>

<p>
My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I recently decided to abandon the idea to work in such fields due to the lack of project oriented end-to-end work and the lack of a final product and creation.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the best of my educational background I am now ready to shift my focus towards Software Engineering and the fast developing data-driven industries with the hope of making soon part of an ambitious group working towards turning revolutionary ideas into practice for the benefit of the community as a whole.
</p>
