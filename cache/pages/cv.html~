Hi, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>

I am a young professional that likes to breathe technology and be future oriented.
The goal is to always work in a team that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I decided
to deviate at first from the most logical career path given my education. 

<br>
<br>

Alone, pure math won't work; it has to be enriched by sound engineering best practices.
I grow up the belief that such practices make the difference in the real and the data world and decided at first to enrich my knowledge in the latter.

<br>
<br>

Just with a solid basis on such practices it is possible to apply sophisticated math models in a meaningful way by creating winning ecosystems (see for instance the ML movement of the 2010s)
