Tired of reading my work related stuff? Wanna get to know me
better? This page is for you. After all we human come as a package,
you don't get just the work related skills you also get the character of
the person. 

Mine has a couple of tons of limitations that I constantly work on,
some traits that some will appreciate and some will question and some
traits that are working under cover and are not known to me in
person - looking forward to get to know them.

So here my Photo Blog. Let me open up a little bit; not too much! For
this we have to become /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship][friends]]/. One Photo per month such that it
will hold its value and will stay there as an album in time.

My first home made pasta! What a fatigue! You have to put your soul
