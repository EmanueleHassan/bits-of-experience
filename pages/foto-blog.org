I do not use social networks such as Instagram and it is long time
since I used Facebook. They are not for me.

Still I think that there is a pro in sharing images, without the big
stress of having to appear. They will tell a bit about your
personality. Still if you share too much the value gets lost.

So here my Photo Blog. One Photo per month such that it will hold its
value and will stay there as an album in time.

My first home made pasta! What a fatigue! You have to put your soul
into it when working the pasta. Tough sport!
