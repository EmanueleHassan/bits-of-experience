This Blog is an experimental trial of Summer 2019 to keep an up to date overview over my study learning encounters. 

I expect to learn much cool stuff in the next two years during my Master's study and hence I thought it might be a good idea to write some succinct posts as a way to express new learned material in a simple way via coding examples thereby facilitating understanding. On the same time this aims to be a personal future guide to refresh some content.

Notice moreover that the Blog is not simply focused around pure mathematical statistics content as I rather intend to incorporate in the latter learning from the field of Software Engineering and keep an up to date guide of /new/ emacs surprises and modifications.

I hope you will enjoy the Blog and that it will be a successful ride; but before let me provide you with some general guidelines.


*Important note: /Learning Posts/ and General Blog Philosophy?*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I intend this blog not as the place where I publish end products and well rounded posts but rather as a way to share my learning and software related experiences. 

As such everything is an open construction site. Posts are written on things I am /currently learning/ and as such there might be some simplification and inaccuracies reported. Just take the software end products and the emacs code as functional. The theory might be revisited in certain posts but stay positive, later posts might contain new understanding and provide a more exact picture on the subject.

Let's start the ride by following [[https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/index.html][this link]] or clicking on the folder image on the website.

Always positive,
