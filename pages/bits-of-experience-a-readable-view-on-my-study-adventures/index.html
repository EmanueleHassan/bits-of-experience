This Blog is an experimental trial of Summer 2019 to keep an up to
date overview over my study learning encounters.
</p>

<p>
I like to explore. I did that throughout my life and this led me to
explore multiple scientific fields. At the beginning of my Bachelor's
I had quite an extensive training in Macroeconomics and International
Macroeconomics. Then during my first Master's I started to go deeper
into Finance, its major theories, volatility, risk modeling and
derivatives pricing. At the same time I started to dig deeper in CS
and algorithms. Finally in my second Master's I further explored
mathematical statistics and got some knowledge of Information
Technology Systems. During my work I also like to explore - especially
IoT and BlockChain Technologies where I see huge potential-.
</p>

<p>
During these years I enjoyed to see how wide the human theories
reached and how in every field there is so much accumulated knowledge
that just by understanding how a field operates, its history and
current direction, you should feel proud. 
</p>

<p>
If you are one of the lucky that on top of it truly shapes the
direction in the field, then you are probably an <i><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfant_prodige">enfant prodige</a></i> that
entered soon in the nitty gritty of th field and grew within it. If
you manage to master more than one field… well then you are the new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bottom line</i>: there is so much interesting content out there that it
is easy to get lost in it. I probably did so multiple time in my
search of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">holy grail</a> that does not exist. By now I understand the
importance of documenting the learning encounters. You probably will
not be able to learn as fast as it requires some effort that you might
spend on learning new material, but, at the end of the day, it will
help you to put some mental structure in the way you study and
work. Finally, especially if you explore and change fields as I did it
is a good practice to keep record and have the chance to rewind,
either to apply some knowledge in different areas, or due to curiosity
or maybe due to some nostalgic attack.
</p>

<p>
From here the idea of writing a Blog. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Important note: <i>Learning Posts</i> and General Blog Philosophy?</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I intend this blog not as the place where I publish end products and
well rounded posts but rather as a way to share my learning and
software related experiences. It should be a flow not a marketing
campaign. 
</p>

<p>
As such everything is an open construction site. Posts are written on
things I am <i>currently learning</i> and as such there might be some
simplification reported. There might even be dirty shortcuts and some
may just serve as repositories for the future. 
</p>

<p>
Just take the software end products and the emacs code as
functional. Usually for the theoretical part I prefer to work with
handwritten material. I therefore created a special section dedicated
to it where I keep my notes.
</p>

<p>
I might start to write serious theoretical posts once I do not work
and study concurrently and will have more time to dedicate to the
activity. 
</p>

Always positive,
