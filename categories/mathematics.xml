So this is another post containing basic mathematical things. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is about combinatorics. It is all material of high school level. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The issue is that you often make confusion and loose track of the
thing. This post is intended to summarize the knowledge such that you
can always come back at it and you will have it fresh in your memory.
&lt;/p&gt;

So another posts where you should summarize a bit of concepts that you
already studied multiple times and you forget.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But these are important. I am doing now again some microeconomics and
there you have the concept of Pareto efficiency. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This comes from the property of shadow prices in linear
programming. The fact is that in these economics books they do not
focus on the math but to its application to the specific subject and
interpret the result based on the exercise at hand. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, that might make sense because you can understand some notions of
the subject at hand in such a way. This is the ultimate goal in
applied math.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But if you understand the general math behind it you then have a
general frame that you can apply to different subjects. This is why
you are interested in the general understanding of the math theory
behind it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You study it periodically and then you forget it. Not good. These
posts intend to fix the issue. You will have a digital place in the
future where you could find your results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
