&lt;p&gt;
This is possibly not even a post. Rather a quick entry but I like my
blog with the different tags to find the material quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started recently using tramp mode to ssh into some Raspberry devices
as I got some &lt;i&gt;TJbots&lt;/i&gt; to play with. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was aware that with tramp mode you could simply ssh into a file and
edit it from your local device, no &lt;i&gt;nano&lt;/i&gt; or such horrible programs
needed. Moreover you keep your IoT device thin as you don't have to
install any special software on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, I was missing a proper shell on it. It turned out that if you
start an &lt;code&gt;eshell&lt;/code&gt; while being sshed into a file on your IoT device
via tramp mode you will have your wonderful &lt;code&gt;eshell&lt;/code&gt; written
completely in emacs and customizable according to your needs, with all
of the nice auto-completition on the top of it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There seems to be some overhead, as sometimes it reacts sluggishly
however this is hardly noticeable and a great way to work on remote
devices to my mind.
