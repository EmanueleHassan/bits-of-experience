So recently I had to do quite some big refactoring and merging for
some code base.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I knew about emacs &lt;code&gt;ediffing&lt;/code&gt; packages that I used already a couple
of times in the past. It is just a little bit confusing at the
beginning as it is often the case with emacs, you might well be
overwhelmed at the beginning. Too many nice features and you might
quickly get lost in it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The below video should give you a quick introduction to ediffing in
emacs. It is just a very basic tutorial. Then to get more detailed
information you should check at the &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; (at the
quick help commands section) telling you about all of the different
commands that are quite a few.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last week I set up my working laptop and the SSH key to access my
private working github repository.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A question arise: &lt;i&gt;How to add an additional SSH-key to modify the
content on my public github registry?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/Multiple%20SSH%20Keys%20for%20different%20accounts%20on%20a%20single%20machine/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (1 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>git</category><category>Github</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/Multiple%20SSH%20Keys%20for%20different%20accounts%20on%20a%20single%20machine/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 16:21:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Git Useful Commands</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/git-useful-commands/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
So here are some notes about some useful commands in git.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I might start to use it again from the command line as magit in my
emacs is dead slow on Windows OS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I read online that there are some fundamental issues with it on
Windows.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not the only program where I am experiencing some performance
hiccup on Windows systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will switch back to Mac soon as it seems that here in the company
they started to offer the possibility to have one. Have to wait a
couple of months for it still as I have to wait for the migration of
the IT systems to the cloud to have proper access to everything
without having to manually make new auth-modules. 
&lt;/p&gt;
