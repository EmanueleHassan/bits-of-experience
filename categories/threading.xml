So apparently this is a thing that I will have to master sooner or
later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am not a fun of it as I know it gets tricky to write solid programs
with mulit-threading when complexity increases.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For a solution that I am trying to construct I will need that bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This for two reasons:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the existing solution uses it; meaning that it is beneficial for
you to read and understand it in order for understand the current
design and borrow from it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
your new solution would either have flavours of it or use queues. I
am rather inclined for the second but I promised to provide a
solution for both and this is what I am currently working for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Update:&lt;/i&gt; after one day I could set up a working solution with
multithreading. Was not too difficult. But it is just at conceptual
level. The gist of it is more less along &lt;a href="https://alyssaq.github.io/2014/how-do-I-return-a-http-response-to-caller-and-continue-processing/"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; lines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am not an extremely low level programmer due to my background. At
least not so far. So this is the reason I do not conceptually like the
thing and would prefer to go with a much more simple queueing
solution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I learned in life that you should not stop in front of your conceptual
barriers. You should be aware of your gaps and taking extra care when
making a step in that direction so that you do not hurt yourself, but
by baby steps everything is possible. This is how we learn since
inception.
&lt;/p&gt;
