Wow.. things are starting to get interesting. The issue is that in the
new job, you do not simply have to tackle down a system that looks
challenging to tackle down, with lots of tech involved and, possibly,
a fair amount of math.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You have as well to deal with a business machine that is equally
complex. The organization and the structure of the entire machine
is interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to well perform at the job a good understanding of both is
necessary. So I am taking a bit of time now to structure the
understing in this dimension and to understand how the investment
management machine works in bigger insurance companies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that I am keeping these notes very general and I am just writing
here publicly available information. These notes mainly derive on the
public document outling the structure of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbpPqt5eXzAhVE_KQKHdhmA_YQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zurich.com%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fproject%2Fzurich%2Fdotcom%2Fsustainability%2Fdocs%2Finvestment-management-value-creation-2014.pdf%3Fla%3Den&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2m5DSA7AYGq9OfYan1QB7h"&gt;zurich insurance investment
management&lt;/a&gt;, which is very well in line with what I can observe in my
position.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to expand your understanding in this sense, you can &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/investment/evolution-insurer-strategies-long-term-investing.pdf"&gt;read the
following document by oecd&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that such a general macro-view is necessary as through it you
will make better sense on the applicaiton of your market-risk system
and can better understand the stakeholder you will have to deal with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
