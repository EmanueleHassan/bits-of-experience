So you already worked with python testing frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The set up was already in place back then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now it is more than a year that I do not touch the thing and
everything is solidly gone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Luckily I have a repo on my Github with some structure of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will leverage that now, plus I will start to write some notes, such
that people that will have to collaborate with me can reference to
it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top of it, it will be useful for the future as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Plus finally it is always nice to see the things in multiple
languages. It is always the same story. By adding pieces to the puzzle
the picture becomes systematically clearer not the opposite. 
&lt;/p&gt;

So I am starting to deliver some solutions on some minor features on
some applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There was quite a bit of work to be done in the last couple of
months. I mean I had to get up and running with Java, reverse engineer
some bit of application, write documentation etc. I am slowly getting
up to speed. I have still quite a few things on my mind and I guess
that to reach the point where I would like to be it will be another
6-12 months but I am moving at a &lt;i&gt;decent&lt;/i&gt; speed so that I am not
complaining too much.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The structure and challenges of the job gets clearer everyday so that
is fine - now it is a question of adapting and working strategically
to overcome the various issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next bit that is on the list is about testing. This post deals
with it. I am ready to get up and running with it and start to write
well-covered software. In a further step you can then imagine some
further integration with tools as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonarQube"&gt;sonarqube&lt;/a&gt; etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cool. Starting to test seriously. Like this we can soon set up serious
devOps pipelines.
&lt;/p&gt;
