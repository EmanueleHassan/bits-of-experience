Today I feel well. I got rejected for a PhD application, the only one
I made in my life, and most likely the last one. But no this post is
not about the usual stuff: "&lt;i&gt;yeah it is ok to fail, I feel well
despite it&lt;/i&gt;". Of course I do, by now I understood what matters to me
in life. Nothing that is work related will ever gonna take the smile
out of me, nor put it for what it counts. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Despite it, I want to share and put down to words some thoughts. After
all it is an event that could have changed my life and it is a good
exercise to write a few words about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
