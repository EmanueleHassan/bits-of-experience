Supervised Machine Learning is when you have a labeled autocome. You
know the outcome for the training set and based on that you want to
predict new unlabled data.

Supervised learning is either regression or classification.

If you have unlabled data, then we talk about unsupervised
learning. We learn from the data. We might identify clusters of data
despite not knowing what the dimension of the data represent because
of them being unlabled. Mostly concerned about measuring distance
among data points in hyperdimensional vector spaces.
