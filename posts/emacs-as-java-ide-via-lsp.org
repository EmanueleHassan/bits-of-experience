So I will work quite a lot with Java in the next couple of years. So I
have to properly set up a strong IDE and workflow for working in it.

I know that the majority of the people do not think much of emacs in
terms of IDE but since the language-server-protocol integrations I
believe they can be as strong as more mainstream IDEs such as Visual
Code out there. t.

I even think that they can be better once you get into it
enough. After a bit of research I am quite sure about the fact.

In fact this was my experience with Python and now the step is simply
to get ot that level of costumization with emacs. So here some notes
on my way of making emacs a top environment for java and improve my
productivity with it in the long-term.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

* Resources

Look at the following [[https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/08/07/debug-adapter-protocol-website][blog entry]] and [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/][this entry]].

There you will understand why emacs is nothing else than VS-code. So
people that tell you that VS-code is a better IDE than emacs have
obviously no idea how VS-code works in the background.

Add to a perfect functioning IDE all of the major emacs mode that have
little to no rival:

- org-mode

- magit

- projectile

- imenu

- hs-minor-mode  

etc. and you will soon get the reason why emacs is 10x better than any
other workflow solution out there.

Also note that you should not get confused. The underlying language
servers that you install are running in localhost so that your code is
never leaving your machine.

You can in fact see in emacs the =pid= that they are running on as it
is prompted in any source file where you are developing with the
integration of the language server protocol.

I tried then to find the process on my local laptop. On windows
systems you can do that with the following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
netstat -aon
#+END_SRC

Note that interestingly the process is listening on =0.0.0.0= for
connections on =0.0.0.0= so actually anyone knowing the port and IP of
my machine can connect to that language server. I was rather thinking
more of a =127.0.0.1= solution as default to be honest.

That said you can now explore the functionalities of the language
server protocol and how the infor is displayed in the emacs UI.

Check as well [[https://xpressrazor.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/java-programming-in-emacs/][this tutorial]] that shows some basics functioning of
java-lsp. 

* Find reference

  =lsp-find-references=:  For an object visualize where it is used in
  your project. I.e. it searches across all of your files in the
  project. You can then navigate across them in the usual way.

  Note that this si actually very similar to the ag-search you used to
  do through projectile. No big difference in this sense.

  you can either do it in this version or via
  =peek-reference=. understand which one of the both you like the
  most.

  note that you have understand the difference among reference and
  implementations when searching.

  you search for references for objects or variables.

  you search for implementations of classes and interfaces.

* peek references

  basically the same as finding by reference. it will display more
  information in the same buffer though.

  you will not just see the references such that you can hover there
  and jump to the statement but rather you will have two frames side
  by side where hovering over one statement it will already display
  the code for that piece of information.

  I might even like this better. it is not bad as you see on the code
  and then if you select it you actually jump to that piece of code as
  in the normal way.
  
* IN-PROGRESS Alternative to the Reference possibilities

  Note that I am having currently some problems with the reference
  methods above, apparentlz the project is too big and everzthing
  eventually crashes.

  I guess that the issue will eventually be fixed in future versions.

  In the meanwhile I have a quite handy solution. This involves in
  leveraging =ripgrep= in combination with projectile.

  It is in this sense possible to search for keywords, text and
  regular expressions across your project.

  You will then see where the thing is used across the project.

  This is pretty much the same functionality of the above. Peek
  reference would be cooler if it would be properly working.

  As you could see on the fly the different references and could make
  sense of them on the fly. I guess that you will have to ask a lot to
  your emacs for working in such a way. Especially in these larger
  projects. 

* Refactor
  
** general refactoring - naming etc

   when you call the rename option through the =lsp= server you should
   actually rename all of the variables across all of the source files
   in the project. this is actually not happening in my case so there
   must still be some minor error.

** refactoring of parameters

   note that in Java you can not assign default to parameters.

   this is a big drawback to my mind.. it was pretty useful as a
   feature.

   now you have the option to implement the default parameters either
   by overloading the stuff, or by encapsulating some information into
   some object or finally by using the option of eclipse of
   refactoring.

   Depending on the circumstances one might be better than the
   other. It is a question of experience and of checking how different
   things work.

   So the idea is that if you enter the refactoring view, you will
   have the option of *changing method signature*.

   This is a nice way to set a default. You can in fact add a
   parameter and specify over there the default such that eclipse will
   actually change all of the existing methods by adding the parameter
   of choice with the *default* value of choice.

* Flycheck

  With =lsp-ui-flycheck-list= you will get a list with all of the
  errors and inconsistencies you have in your source files.

  that is good and it corresponds to your eclipse way of seeing your
  errors etc.

  Note that there you see as well the todos as in eclipse so there is
  a 1:1 in this sense.

  See for instance the following on the 101 spring application I am
  working on:

  #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-02-03 164053.png" class="center">
  #+end_export

  /Update 01/05/2022:/

  Flycheck 32 was finally released. This solved the flycheck issues I
  was experiencing with the lsp-java interaction.

  Was good to subscribing to the issue where this was being
  discussed. It kept me up to date for the release.

  Now it is cool cause you can have a per buffer list of your
  errors. You can also quickly navigate the errors with all of the
  available flycheck commands.

  Finally you will have the highlighted TODOs and errors.

  So cool - you have a better set up than eclipse in this sense now.

* lsp format buffer

  reformat the buffer based on what the language server thinks it
  makes sense.

  =lsp-format-buffer=.

  not that recommended. use different packages that are tailored to
  the language for doing code-formatting.

  usually it works better. 

* Projectile

  this is strong as it gives you all of the options to navigate your
  project and code.

  i.e. jump to the test files etc. I mean this is a non-specific lsp
  thing, so you can understand it online and is out of scope for this
  entry.

  Here you have as well all of the functions that keep track how you
  moved across buffers and files in your project and you can then move
  back and forth in a fast way with all of the shortcuts that you have available.

** Building and Testing

  Ok that is not properly lsp-related but let's put it in here. Maybe
  I will then write some separate notes on projectile later.

  You can run your projects from emacs with the =projectile
  run-project= command.

  Here you can then pass for instance your =gradlew.bat build=
  command.

  However, note that you might as well not work in such a way. This
  for instance when you are working with your stack with Spring. 

  You can even run the unit-root tests for your project by running
  =projectile test-project=.

  Working as a charm now. Just have to configure it with =gradle= for
  your actual project but then you are good to go.

* class hierarchy

  you can visualize the class hierachy with =lsp-ui-imenu=

  this is essentially the same information as you can have with the
  [[*lsp-header-breadcrumb][lsp-header-breadcrumb]] below.

  so I would not recommend it too much.

* lsp-header-breadcrumb

  search it. will show you on the top of your buffer the hierarchy for
  where you are at in your buffer.

  i.e. what file, in which class etc.

  this will adapt as you cycle through your code and it should help
  you a bit to keep the visibility over your entire code. 

* Project Root

  That is important as from there the lsp starts and make all of the
  connections.

  This will allow you to jump to variables and declarations at a
  project wide level.

  I managed to adjust the project root by removing the existing
  project root that I firstly selected in just a subspace of the
  working directory where just an application among the many was
  defined. This was not good as that application was using some gneral
  classes that were designed to be used across all of the applications
  and were therefore on a different path of the hierarchy that was not
  available through my project root.

  In this sense I had to adapt my project root. This was done in the
  following way.

  First you have to see and understand the location of your
  configuration file of your lsp-sessions. For this you can call the
  variable =lsp-session-file= by calling ~C-h v~.

  Once you find such a location you can delete that file, close your
  emacs, restart it, navigate a source file of your project.

  You will be asked then to select the project root for your
  lsp. There you should not select the proposed root that will be
  inferred from the application specific =git= and =gradle= files but
  you rather select the option to choose the root of the project
  interactively. Then you can navigate to the real root of the project
  that includes all of the submodules.

  In such a way you should have a lsp server that is able to properly
  infer all of your relations for your entire project and you can jump
  to *implementations* and *definitions* for all of your methods,
  classes and variables across your entire projects.

* On checking the hierarchy and dependencies

  For visualizing the dependencies and get a general overview of a
  package I like to use the ~lsp-treemacs-java-deps-list~ function.

  There you can quickly visualize the pacakges structures and
  visualize the classes available in a given file together with the
  methods of them.

* treemacs

  Note that this is a different module but I also like this a lot and
  the integration with lsp mode.

  It is nice cause you can see the hierarchy of the files that you are
  calling and get a general overview of how your projects are
  structured.

  Moreover it is nice that treemacs will follow you when jumping from
  one file to the next. Especially in very large projects with tons of
  files and repositories it is convenient.

  In such a way you will be able to visualize the anchestors of your
  file and explore what sits around that source file in the
  hierarchy. That is pretty much informative already and will help you
  to quickly make sense of your code.  

  -------

  /Update 01/05/2022:/ For the point I set up dired-sidebar to
  function in the same way.

  Probably it is better to work with it. You have now shortcuts to
  open and close it in a very fast way across your buffers.

  In the sense that you save yourself the time to edit the treemacs
  workspaces etc.

  You will have to explore in time though. Might be that for
  programming itself is better as it is more standard and better
  integrated. 

  -------

  Note that in a similar way to lsp there is quite annoying story with
  the set up. I.e. once you select a root/workspace every time you
  open treemacs you will be prompted to that workspace no matter where
  you are working on your file-system.

  There are ways to deal with it. You can check your documentation
  [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][online]]. You can basically call =treemacs-edit-workspaces= and edit
  there your workspaces.

* Troubleshooting

  Look at this [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/troubleshooting/][troubleshooting]] url when you have issues and want to
  debug stuff.  

* Debugging

  Basically Debugging is based once more on a protocol that
  communicates with a server. In order to understand this properly
  check at [[https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/08/07/debug-adapter-protocol-website][this url]].

  So basically once more you are working with the same debugging
  features as in VS-code.

  Note that you can specify different debugger types that you want to
  work with. This in a similar way as in Eclipse.

  For my projects I am working with a remote Java application. For
  debugging that application I am launching it listening at port 8000
  for debugging.

  You can then specify then a dap-debugger that will try to
  instantiate a connection at that port.

  You can do that for instance by specifying the following template.

  #+begin_src java :results output raw 
(dap-register-debug-template
 "localhost:8000"
 (list :type "java"
  :request "attach"
  :hostName "localhost"
  :port 8000))
  #+end_src 

  You can then enter the debugging modus via =dap-debug= and the hydra
  pop-up will come out. That is particularly useful as it will lock
  some keys that will be useful for debugging. You can then hide it or
  open it via =M-<f5>=.

  You can then start the debugger with =dap-debug= mapped to =<f5>=.
  
** Dap REPL

   Note that this is important as this is the space where you would
   ultimately run your code in order to understand properly what is
   going on.

   I.e. you can make all of your experiments and check at the
   results.

   It is much better done than the respective Eclipse counterpart (the
   debug shell in there).

   Resembles a bit the python console in this sense.

   You can open it via =dap-ui-repl=

* Auto-completion

  Note that auto-completion is also working now. I think that before
  something was broken at configuration level.

  This is my experience with lsp. There are a lot of things going on
  and sometimes things just break.

  It is sensible once in a while to restart everything by deleting the
  =workspace= and the =.lsp-session-v1= file once in a while.

  Note that there is still a lot of confusion around that topic in
  lsp for emacs and the way that things are done there at UI level. In
  order to understand this, check [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-java/issues/201][this]].
  
** TODO autocompleting as well with the return type

   This is suboptimal as you have to cancel it then every time.

   Fix it as it can be quite annoying. 

* Lsp java deps list

  In such a way it is possible to quickly navigate all of the
  necessary dependencies for your projects in your workspace.

  It opens kind of a treemacs thing where you would set the stuff.

* Organize Imports

  Use this. I.e. type =C-c l a-a= and organize imports.

  It will clear all of the imports you do not have to use.

  It will as well import all of the stuff you are using in the file.

  So neat. You see that each day you are closing to working better
  with it. 
    
* Some Eclipse Notes

  This were a backlog as I could not immediately migrarte to my
  project.

  Plus, on the top of it much of the functionalities are shared across
  the two ways of developing.

  Such that understanding how the Eclipse IDE works will help you to
  make the best out of the lsp experience as you know all of the
  features that you could possilbly leverage.

  /Update 02/05/2022:/ fully migrated into emacs - space of choice for
  development purposes. 

  This because emacs is not the most easy way you start from scratch
  in a new environment. Especially for larger projects like this.

  In order to switch I will have to properly understand how =gradle=
  works at some point.

  So understood it, to this stage and in fact I was able to migrate.

  Moreover, I will have to understand all of the testing suites that
  interface with Java and how to properly do the debugging in
  emacs. Also understood.
  
  From what I could see it is nonetheless theoretically possible to
  eventually reach a stage with a much stronger development setting in
  emacs in comparison to standard IDEs. Reached that stage as well.

  In the meanwhile while this process is ongoing check at the
  following notes for using more classical IDEs.
  
** On branch

   One thing that irritates me for instance in the Eclipse IDE is that
   it does not automatically switch branch for my projects when I
   change branch via my shell.

   In order to change branch you need to right-click on the project
   and referesh it. Then the change of branch will be performed. 

** Debugging

   For eclipse you can read [[https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html][this]] documentation.

   Note that you can see the debugging options for which the
   local-server is started in your =LOCAL-tomcat= command file. 

** On problems of references in Eclipse

   Eclipse does not manage to properly get all of the relations when
   you git pull from the shell.

   so be aware and on the lookout for that. in that case you =clean=
   all of the workspace and start over from scratch.

   In order to do that =Project= -> =Clean=. Then you follow the
   instructions there and you can rebuild and it should work.

** Note that in eclipse you have a way to write TODOs and search them then.

   Looks like an interesting feature. Check at it later. 

   Note that in many of my tasks are noted by the follwoing tags

   #+begin_example
   //TODO auto-generated method stub
   #+end_example


   as in the following example.


   #+begin_src java :results output raw 
@Override
public void insert() {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
}
   #+end_src 

   Note that such strings are auto-generated by the Eclipse IDE. It is
   interesting the tag =TODO=. This is a keyword through which you can
   manage your todos. It is interesting especially if you will have
   some searching feature then to organize such todos. 

   The =stub= keyword means that the method is void and has no
   return. 
   
** Autogenerated doc-comment schema

   This is useful as it will give you the skeleton of the doc-comment
   and will save you quite some time.

   You have to find a substitute in emacs once you will get back to
   it. And yes it is a matter of time. It might take longer than
   expected though.

** Broken Eclipse - not understanding project correctly - restart

   Especially now at the beginning, without having a proper
   understanding of the entire thing, I am messing things up a bit.

   It seems that I am particularly capable of breaking the loop eclipse
   <-> gradle etc. In such a way your IDE will not be able to properly
   read the stuff in the project. You will have lots of errors because
   of missing dependecies etc.

   Have to fix it at some point. In any case I still plan to eventually
   migrate on my emacs for the development experience. Then I will be
   properly free.

   In any case for fixing these issues use the following procedere. 

   Delete the following from each gradle project

   - =.gradle= -- build stuff for each library
   - =.settings= -- eclipse settings
   - =.classpath= -- classpath info
   - =.project= -- project info

   on the top of the workspace =.metadata= (here eclipse saves workspace
   config).

   then basically you can close and reopen eclipse. 

   Then change your gradle version to 7.1.1. and set the =java_home=
   correctly. You can do this under project -> properties -> gradle.

   Then basically you are good to go. You click on import -> import
   existing gradle project -> you click on the repos.

   You wait until the built is done. -> you build and deploy.
   
** Multi-Threading Debugging

   this is not a trivial thing. you can read about it in the following
   post.

   the thing is that you might start to stop a single thread, while
   the other threads of the application normally continue to run.

   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5375538/debugging-multiple-threads-in-eclipse/5375589

   -------

   note that I always have an issue of deployment. the jar goes in the
   wrong folder. i.e. the things are packaged in the wrong directory.
   
** On the validation issue

   So basically we work with the mustache framework for embedding some
   logic in the html files.

   Then basically your marks in eclipse complain about it tells you
   that you have errors in your html etc.

** On the Eclipse Debugger

   Have to find the option to go back in time - i.e. of steps.

   I know this is a feature many debuggers provide and I think that it
   is quite handy.

   I found [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4331336/how-to-step-back-in-eclipse-debugger][this entry]]...

   #+begin_quote
Beyond what's been mentioned in earlier answers - i.e. Eclipse's drop
to frame feature in the debug view, which restarts debugging earlier
in the stack frame (but does not revert global/static data) and
Omniscient debugger, which is a bit raw and not so much evolving -
there are a few Eclipse-based tools that could be used to "go back" in
(run)time:

- JIVE: Java Interactive Visualization Environment

- Chronon: A “flight data recorder” for Java programs

- Diver (discontinued): Dynamic Interactive Views For Reverse
  Engineering

- Halik: Only for IntelliJ for now, but porting to Eclipse is
  mentioned on the roadmap.
   #+end_quote

   So search for this entry and explore better these options at some
   point. 
   
** Remove all of the imports that are not used.

   This is also quite handy as Eclipse automatically adds lots of
   imports at development time.

   You can then remove all of the ones you are not needing with
   =CTRL-Shift-O=.
   
** How to kill all existing java related excutions

   This works on windows. You might need it at some point.
   
   #+begin_quote
   taskkill /F /IM java.exe
   #+end_quote

* ISSUES

** DONE Issue 1 - LSP; Server not connecting when switching files
   CLOSED: [2021-09-23 Do. 09:32]

   i.e. if you reference from one file to the other it works but you
   cannot change to a file with other methods such as projectile.

   it will not integrate directly with the lsp server.

   this is an error and issue that you need to fix if you want to work
   with it in a solid way.

   - all solved. this is simply a matter of setting your lsp-session
     correctly. 

*** Note that you manage all of the existing lsp-sessions

    with the =workspace= keyword. check at the the functions involving
    it in there.
   
*** Solution

    At the time the workaround was removing the highlighting at global
    level for lsp. Now it is starting to improve as an IDE.


** DONE On Multi-project builds
   CLOSED: [2022-05-02 Mo. 11:06]

   See your note in your emacs configuration:

   ------------------------
   
   Check at the [[https://issueexplorer.com/issue/emacs-lsp/lsp-java/320][following url]] to understand the issue.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(advice-add 'lsp :before (lambda (&rest _args) (eval '(setf (lsp-session-server-id->folders (lsp-session)) (ht)))))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:

   It is working now. Check also at the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/discussions/3095][following discussion]] to
   understand more.

   Just the single project that you open is shown there in the erros
   sections now in the =lsp-ui-flycheck-list=. If you add a second one
   this is also added to the list in the sense that is managed by the
   same server connection. The only issue is that if you close the
   file it stays in the server connection. This is not ideal and would
   have to sort it somehow. 

   But basically now you have all of the features you desired. Just
   have to check the last thing with the debugger but basically you
   are there. 

   You can now start to run your smaller projects in emacs and start
   to get up and running with it.

   ------------

   Note that this is important to navigate as across project it will
   be important to deal with it in the correct way.

** DONE Lsp-treemacs error list
   CLOSED: [2022-05-03 Di. 10:23]

   That would be the final killer.

   The issue is that it is not unfolding.

   Again probably mostly a Windows OS issue.

   Crazy how much this OS system is less supported by the emacs
   community.

   ----

   Solved it check at your emacs config file.

   That is indeed helping you a lot to keep everything properly in
   order.

   Note that after updating the package you will miss that bit of
   code. You would have to refactor it into a more solid solution in
   this sense.
