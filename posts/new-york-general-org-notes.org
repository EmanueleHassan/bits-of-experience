Since ants are the official theme of the family, here a story of an
ant in New York.  

{{{TEASER_END}}}

* On a General Impression

  I still remember.... I arrive at the airport, do the security check,
  I pick the subway, get off at Lexington Avenue and
  wow... breathtaking, huge skyscrapers all around me. So tight to
  each other. 

  I remember the first 24 hours I was walking with my head
  up. Wondering around, looking at these huge buildings. Feeling like
  an ant. 

  I noted that clouds seems to move faster in the New York skies. I
  think that this is because the sight is less dispersed and can
  capture better the movement in the small distance that separates the
  giants climbing in the skies. 

  -- ADD video of clouds in times square --

  Then you start wondering what the reasoning was to build a city like
  this. Why it emerged as a decision while many other EU wealthy
  countries did not decide to build high in the sky.

  Is it a - /I wanna be/ - syndrome? The way of saying, we are the
  greatest country in the world and we prove it by creating
  an entire city scraping the sky. 

  Sure is that even if you forget about it after a while, you will
  always feel little in a city as this. The city reminds you
  constantly how big man can achieve and how you will always stay a
  little ant as individual in a society that collectively reaches
  greatness. 

  You then start to wonder how such big skyscrapers can be
  maintained. Such large buildings and infrastructure. That is not a
  trivial task and I must say that you already start to experience
  some signals of rotting across the cities. Some of the buildings
  that were clearly the glory of the cities a few decades ago are now
  poorly maintained and have a feeling of a lost greatness that cannot
  be maintained anymore. 

  As I am writing this piece of memories, I stopped and did some
  googling. The issues are confirmed. Nonetheless it seems that NY had
  many dark periods throughout history. See for instance in 1977 with
  the almost bankruptcy, the trash and the mega-rats. It did recover
  then and it might recover now.

  In this sense, it was as well interesting to see the building
  infrastructure in NYC. Never saw a platform so big... probably this
  is how they construct these block-large skyscrapers.

  -- ADD picture of platform construction --
  
  As a final note, it is also interesting to note that skyscrapers in
  New York are not simply tall but fat as well. This is what makes
  them particular. They can span an entire block and with they shiny
  lobbies full of christmas decorations and hannukkiah they leave you
  without words. 

  Ahh.. and side fact. It is fun to see how many jewish people there
  is NYC and how the jewish tradition is represented everywhere. Very
  welcoming. 

* On some foto memories

** On an Ess-A-Bagel wake up. 

   So cool my pod was next to the best bagel place in the city. I never
   had bagel's as good. Not even in Israel. Loved it. Starting the day
   in that way was heaven.

** On an Ant on top of the Rock

   Beautiful view. You can admire the city from above. You can imagine
   the million of lives that go on all around you.

   Down in the city, where the action happens. Millions of stories,
   millions of dreams, millions of hopes, millions of sorrows.

** On an Ant observing the typical Smoky Manholes

   And thinking - what a hell is down the earth of new york?

** On an Ant thinking about the funny way of advertising shops

   A shop without a luminous shield is not enough around the times
   square area. 

   I am pretty sure these shops were out of the area where they are
   required by law to install the luminous shields. 

   So the question is - that is how you attract mosquitoes to the
   sugar?

   It is fun how much exaggerated at times this city is.

** On an Ant trying Pastrami 

   And feeling like Joe's of Friends... thinking - gooooooood!

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Pastrami.jpg" class="center">
#+end_export

   And then thinking... OMG, how to they manage to eat the whole of
   it. It is the most heavy meat-thing I ate since a while.

** On an Ant at the Moma

   Beautiful museums. 

   Two things on top of everything.

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Moma1.jpg" class="center">

   and the weird videos that followed in that room.

   And the Ghandi's *Seven Social Sins*.

** On an Ant in Broadway

   Decided to watch the /phantom of the opera/ - the most classical
   one. Purchased the ticket at discount at the tkts store in times square.

   Well done. Very nice one and worth the experience. 

   You can view very similar performances in other cities. I recall
   the show on Matilde I watched in London.

   I would not say that the level there was any lower. 

   I think in this sense it must be a little bit inflated the idea
   of /Broadway/ but still a very nice experience.

** On an Ant on the Serendipity Island

   Fun Island. Got totally randomly there. Clear Japanese influence. 
   
   You are suddenly in a side universe that well contrast with what
   you are experiencing in the city.

** On an Ant Experiencing a different type of NYC

   Greenwich village and Chelsea. 

   This is the place of my taste. Elegant and not exaggerated areas as I
   like. Normal houses as we are used to in EU. 

   Housing types typical british in their architecture in the area at
   times.

** On an Ant in Washington Park

   Very nice park. Not big. But there you really feel a special
   atmosphere somehow. Not big but you really get the feeling of
   coming together in that park. Very nice. 

#+begin_export html

#+end_export

** On an Ant in Little Italy and Chinatown

   Nothing wow. 

   Little Italy quite horrible actually.

   Chinatown better but still nothing wow. 

   Tried the Joe's Shanghai restaurant. Was supposed to be extremely
   good. People queuing etc. Took something, was good but nothing
   ultra-good. Van set the bar now and I think that it is quite a high
   one in terms of chinese restaurants.... ohh I still think about
   that Munich restaurant at times... delicious.

** On an Ant in Soho

   As well nothing wow. Nothing iconic anymore. Just tons of luxury
   and non-luxury shops.

   Did not get the vibe it is supposed to be known for. 

   Also graffiti quite poor..

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/AudrySoho.jpg" class="center">
#+end_export

   Checked some galleries. Most too modern and pricey. 

   Found a nice one. Also too pricey. But noted the style very
   interesting. Can spend the budget you saved for it in it.

** On an Ant in the Financial Hub of the World

   Again, nothing special. 

   Saw the 9/11 eleven memorial. Huge fountains. The twin towers must
   have been extremely big.

   Also saw Wall Street and the Zurich office. When you see these
   monsters the way you look at your work changes. Incredible the
   power of these corporate. It comes again to the initial message of
   the skyscrapers. At the end they have their figurative power. They
   represent the strength of the institutions. And if you think that
   you are developing the market risk system that is governing such
   monsters well that is impressing and scary.

** On an Ant on the Brooklyn Bridge   

   Wow. Most romantic atmosphere. With all of these pizzeria around it
   also reminded me of /Lady and the Tramp/ for some reason.

** On an Ant on Liberty Island

   Just one sentence. Grande lady Liberty. Great respect for its
   values and what it represents.

   I think part of US values is also because of her. Having such
   strong symbols of liberty is not what every country has.
   
   Was nice to be there and listen to the audio guide. Very well done
   letting the listener be inspired by: /liberty enlightening the
   world/.

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Liberty2.jpg" class="center">
#+end_export

** On an Ant on Ellis Island

   Wonderful Island as well. In the sense that the museum that is
   there is very well done. Worth the time. 

   It will let you better understand why US is a land of
   immigrant. Their immense effort to integrate immigrant and build
   this great nation as we know it today.

   When listening to the recordings I could understand very well many
   of the issues myself as having moved from my home-land at young age
   I had to experience many of the same difficulties myself. 

   It is not a trivial task to /properly/ integrate into a country and
   to fully embrace its culture.

** On an Ant having breathtaking view on New York 

   Nothing to add. Just beautiful view on the way back with the ferry.

** On an Ant watching the Nets

   Beautiful. Good players. 

   You see at the end how order and simplicity makes the difference.

   When the team was trying to make something more difficult it was
   simply not working. Order in defense is as well important as that
   might not allow the opponent to shoot in the most serene way, or
   will force them to do that difficult play out of frustration.

** On an Ant in Central Park

   A park like many others. Did not find anything particular in it
   apart from its size.

   Better watched from above. Then it becomes spectacular how it cuts
   the city.
