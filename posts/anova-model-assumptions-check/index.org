Wait for the other part of applied regression and combine the two into
a single post. The other was better done. So there is more meat on the
fire and interesting results from there also apply here.

Then change the post to public.

This third post of the /ANOVA/ series explores the different
assumptions that are required in order for the asymptotic inference on the
significance of group means to be true.

In the specific the model assumptions for which the group specific
means are properly estimated and the ratio of the mean squared errors
converges to the F-distribution depends on the following assumptions:

- /errors are independent/

- /errors are normally distributed/

- /homoscedasticity of the variance/

- /zero mean error expectation/

I will next explore and test the four based on a toy dataset.

This compares the empirical quantiles to the theoretical quantiles of
a normal. If the empirical quantiles of the error term are in line
with the normality assumption we should observe the data points to lie
on the 45 degree line.

Notice that you can address the issue of the normality distribution by
transforming your variables; moreover a failure of normality is will
imply that the OLS estimation will not be BLUE, however the majority
of the results will still hold for the estimation.

This plots the residuals \eplison{ij} vs. the fitted values
\hat{\mu + \alpha_i}. The idea is to check if there is any systematic
relation among the fitted values and the residuals. If this is the
case the independence of the errors is not given. 

Moreover the plot might help to assess, whether we observe
homoscedasticity of the errors or rather if heteroscedasticity is
present.

Notice that the red line represents the LOESS estimator. It is hence a
smoother and a local parametric fit.
