    <p>
So I finally took some time to go over the documentation and make some
notes about the different naming conventions and some basics
structures you should get when building larger projects.
</p>

<p>
I just finished a third larger python project and I am by now
conscious of the strength of well organized code. It can save you a
very big amount of time, especially when your projects start to grow
very large and it becomes difficult to keep a clean mental structure
over the code-base.
</p>

<p>
I therefore started to write a couple of posts where I am writing and
will update my way of working and structuring projects. I will expand
on it in time once my knowledge will expand and more sophistication
will occur.
</p>

<p>
This particular posts deals with the basics structures that you have
to understand to properly set up projects and manage to well deal with
larger code-bases. 
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
The first important difference you have to understand is the one among
<code>script</code>, <code>modules</code> and <code>packages</code>. Just when you will understand this
properly you will be able to well structure projects.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org024138f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org024138f">Script vs. Module vs. Package</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org024138f">
<p>
So notice that there is an inherit difference among the three. The
first one; the <code>script</code> is the ultimate file you pass to your
python interpreter when running your program.
</p>

<p>
A <code>module</code> is a support file containing some python code that you
call from within a runtime. Or using python official documentation
terms:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use
them in a script or in an interactive instance of the
interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module
can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the
collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed
at the top level and in calculator mode).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So that is basically it and the distinction between a module and a
script is not that big.
</p>

<p>
Note as well this <code>__name__</code> object that you often use when
programming. This has the following meaning:
</p>

<p>
Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as
the value of the global variable <code>__name__</code>. In such a way you can
easily write if statements that depending on the case where the
file will be a <code>module</code> or a <code>script</code> (in this case the <code>__name__</code>
is bounded to "<span class="underline"><span class="underline">main</span></span>") will perform different actions.
</p>

<p>
However, what is important to understand is that the scope of each
variables is dependent on the file it resides in. This is important
to understand. Once you get this, it will be possible for you to
avoid loosing time because of issues relating to some
non-accessible variables etc.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand this, note again the words of the official
documentation:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgfc3eca2">
Each module has its own *private symbol table*, which is used as the
global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus,
the *author* of a module can use global variables in the module
without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global
variables.

On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you
can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used
to refer to its functions, =modname.itemname=.
</pre>

<p>
So that is essentially the idea.. each module has its own global
variables and namespace. This has pro and cons. It will help you to
avoid conflicts as everything is well separated. On the other hand
this means that modules that are installed in another module are
not automatically in the private symbol table of a particular
module such that you will have to import them once more.
</p>

<p>
As following coding best practices you should write your code one
and one time only it makes sense to organize functions and
libraries you often use and import in your modules in a distinct
package that you might call <code>utils</code>.
</p>

<p>
The final component that you will use when creating your Python
projects are <code>packages</code>. You can think about packages as a way to
organize modules.
</p>

<p>
In official docu terms:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2486eb2">
Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules
from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use
of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like
NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other’s module names.
</pre>

<p>
So you get the point… although from a practical point of view I
see it more as way to separate your modules and program in logical
structure and keep the code clean.
</p>

<p>
Note just that in order for a repository to count as package you
have to add to it the <code>__init__.py</code> module. You can either leave it
blank or you can put code into it that it will be executed when the
package is imported as such, i.e. when you import the package name
without a path to a module in that package.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to use such a module to store global variables
and to store packages that you will use within your project.
</p>

<p>
You can then access such global variables within the module in the
following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">PACKAGENAME</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">GLOBAL</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">VARIABLE</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">SAVED</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">IN</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">THE</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">INIT</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
and even if you run the above in a module inside a given package it
will work well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9446a18" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9446a18">On that many .pyc modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9446a18">
<p>
To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of
each module in the <span class="underline"><span class="underline">pycache</span></span> directory under the name
module.version.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the
compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number.
</p>

<p>
So that is what all of these auto-generated directories are. You
can safely ignore them when committing your code, however you
should not cancel them at any time form your project. This is order
to not have to recompile the entire module each time. 
</p>

<p>
Python checks the modification date of the source against the
compiled version to see if it’s out of date and needs to be
recompiled. This is a completely automatic process. Also, the
compiled modules are platform-independent, so the same library can
be shared among systems with different architectures.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb51870f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb51870f">On relative paths</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb51870f">
<p>
Here you should specify the path relative to the package you are
currently working (i.e. relative to the package where your module
resides).
</p>

<p>
Note that the directory from which relative paths are defined is
the one of your <code>script</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Note that relative path just work across <code>packages</code>, i.e. you
cannot reference a module that is not part of a package with
relative paths.
</p>

<p>
Note that the directory where your script is running is the root
directory. I.e. everything is defined relative to that. Notice that
you cannot go higher in the tree in comparison to that directory.
</p>

<p>
Or at least you should use tricks then. A very good entry is under
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16981921/relative-imports-in-python-3">this url</a>. The one you up-voted.
</p>

<p>
And within it there is this trick of defining a function from which
you can change the root directory for relative paths so to say.

</pre></div>

<p>
That is quite useful, for instance when you want to test some of
your modules that require a different module in a different
package.
</p>

<p>
Note however that if you start to import modules in different
packages you will run into errors when working in such a way.
</p>

<p>
This because when you program all of your code you specify all of
the relative path in relation to the <code>src</code> directory - i.e. the
directory where your <code>__main__</code> script is.
</p>

<p>
You will hence get errors as, in the case above, the relative path
would be in relation to the module you are running your tests for.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org52a03ef" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org52a03ef">Adding the root directory from which the imports are specified</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org52a03ef">
<p>
So the one strategy you can use to circumvent this would be to set
the root where your normal <code>__main__.py</code> <i>script</i> is. Then you do
not have to modify the relative path of all of your modules.
</p>

<p>
You can do that in the following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"__main__"</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">__package__</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>

       <span class="c1">## add the path of the root directory so that you get relative</span>

<div id="outline-container-org3eb194a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3eb194a">On Naming Conventions According to PEP8</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3eb194a">
<p>
<code>Modules</code> should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can
be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python
<code>packages</code> should also have short, all-lowercase names, although
the use of underscores is <b>discouraged</b>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Some other practice; I do not think it is PEP but would have to
double check it.
</p>

<p>
Note that some people like to call their <i>script</i>, i.e. the file
they execute the <code>__main__.py</code>.
</p>

<p>
It is up to you if you want to follow that structure or not. You
can make some research on the best practice in the following
