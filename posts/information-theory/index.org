#+END_COMMENT


So I will start to collect a bit of random thoughts about information
theory.

I must say that I regret not having properly studied it at Univeristy
time. I remember that I wanted to check at it at some point. I was
especially interested in theory about wavlets and fourier transform.

Now I got more interested in it as I think that by approaching
scientifically the noise that is out there you might be able to reduce
it and properly intercept the messages.

On the top of it, it's beautiful the way you can apply information
theory to many different scientific fields. 

{{{TEASER_END}}}


** On some basic concepts

   So this is quite interesting.

   The basis is in this paper:

   #+begin_quote
Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of
uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy
channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude
Shannon in a paper entitled =A Mathematical Theory of Communication=.
   #+end_quote

   Note that the essential idea is the following:

   Information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the
   goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have
   the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error,
   in spite of the channel noise.

   So note that if somebody wants to convey messages across a channel
   it will most likely respect this basic theory.

   Now there is as well a major result:

   #+begin_quote
Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem showed that,
in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is
asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity
dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the
messages are sent.
   #+end_quote

   So there are now a couple of questions:

   - /What are these statistics?/

   - /Think about the internet. How did it affected these statistics/.

     The channel is getting bigger. But if the information is the
     same how do you keep the message alive and keep tranmitting it
     /with a low frequency of error/? Do you increase the repetitions
     of the message?

     The case I have in mind is the one where the receiver is
     not known. It is out there in the wild. I do not think that the
     theory developed addresses this case. I think it rather assume
     that receiver and sender are synchronized. They work along the
     same frequency so to say.

   Anyways, come back later at it.


** Some Basic Measures Quantifying Uncertainty


*** Entropy

    This is a way to *measure* the *average uncertainty in a random
    variable*.

    #+end_export

    Note the log in base 2. That is often used in computer science
    given the important of the binary system.

*** Mutual Information

    The reduction in uncertainty /due to another random variable/ is
    called the mutual information.

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-15 114155.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    So you can see that you can interpret it as the reduction in
    average uncertainty from knowing the other random variable. It is
    hence as well a measure of dependence among the two random
    variables.


** IN-PROGRESS continue by reading the following


   Continue by reading [[https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc524.142/LarsTelektronikk02.pdf][the following]]. -> Not very good. More giving
   background on what generally happened.

   It goes little in the details of the formulas and you cannot really
   understand much from it.

   
*** Downloaded the book - Elements of Information theory

    Read it. Should be quite interesting.
