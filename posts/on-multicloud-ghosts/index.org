Funny world. 

I was reading a bit on the multi-cloud developments and the offer of
AWS with JUKE and Microsoft with its Azure Arc.

I already imagine squads of sales people of the companies trying to
sell the two as multi-cloud vendors. I wonder how many people will
really buy it.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

It is interesting to note that around one year ago when IBM was
seriously entering the market as a pioneer some incumbent employee was
naming multi-cloud as "total bulls***t"[fn:1].

The employee in the article was making the point that as long as cloud
services will be tight to a cloud platform - and not packaged into
portable solutions - there will be no multi-cloud world.

IBM in the meanwhile repackaged its entire cloud service offer into
cloud packs to make such world a reality. With the services being
containerized the multi cloud dream is becoming reality. 

Imagine a world where all cloud vendors containerized their offer. You
could then deploy services on your Kubernetes clusters. No API calls
to services running on cloud infrastructure. Deployment and compute
power right at the edge. Cloud vendor neutrality; portability of their
services to the public cloud offering the best security, availability,
SLA features at the lowest price. Ahhh what a beautiful world.. 

What the incumbents are offering at the moment is a plain vanilla
dashboard to manage kubernetes workloads - be it on-prem, on private
or public cloud - that leverage the cloud services via API calls. This
in addition to some networking capabilities across clouds as well as
some unified storage for your Kubernetes cluster. Of course a step
into multi-cloud but quite a fragile one and far away from the ideal
world above. The core question that leads to multicloud - i.e. vendor
lock in is not solved.

I wonder if such incumbents are in a hybrid trap where they do not
want to risk they market share becoming cloud neutral, or whether they
are simply making noise around buying some time, while seriously
trying to catch up on the new world.
