So what is a Market Risk System?

This post tries to answer that question.

This post aims to be the guide for your intrinsic motivation for
working on the system and should pose the basis for reaching higher
goals in your work.

It is important to have goals in life.

It is the same as in the field of mathematics. People say that once
you have a proper problem definition you are half-way through the
problem, everything else is sequential.

So let's define and let's hope then everything will be sequential
then. 

{{{TEASER_END}}}

* On a general overview

  In order to proper understand what a market risk system is, I like
  the following paper.

  Even if it is from 1997, I must say that the general idea of the
  paper is still very valid.

* Most important take-away points - Fusion with personal experience

** On a system in Motion
  
   I like it the dynamic idea that the paper gives - already from the
   abstract the point is clear:

   #+begin_quote
   Technical progress will make this tradeoff more favorable over time,
   leading firms to implement more accurate methodologies, such as full
   revaluation of nonlinear positions. The current and likely future
   improvements in risk management information systems make feasible new
   ways of collecting aggregate data on firms' risk-taking activities.
   #+end_quote

   So this is your first important take-away: *never think the system
   as static*.

   Embrace the modern technological advances and the cloud-native
   software development movement in order to push the boundaries of
   your system to the technological natural barriers.

  
** On a conservative mind-set

   I like as well a lot the point made in the first chapter. This is
   very true. From a technological view-point the system is not even
   super-complex. There are much more data-heavy and involving systems
   around. However, what is challenging is the essential complexity of
   Market Risk. Trust me to properly understand the internal capital
   modeling of a large insurance is not a trivial task.

   Add on the top of it, the history of the industry that is causing a
   very traditional mindset that makes the companies very resistent to
   a full appreciation of the power of modern IT architectures and you
   soon will realize the difficulty of setting up a state of the art
   risk system in the industry.

   People working in the industry are very clever. They see the
   tech-advances and they realize the world is changing. Still they are
   very well aware that at the end their core-business is finance. In
   this sense I think that, at least to some degree, the focus is not
   to waste too much energies in developing the most advanced risk
   system being always up to date with the latest technological
   trend. At least not if in terms of output there is no tangible
   benefit for the risk capturing mechanism and no added value across
   the investement management value chain.

   For instance, there is little interest if the system takes 1-2 days
   for running the entire simulations or 2 h. Do you save lots of money
   doing it? No. Does the migration involve risk? Yes. Does the
   migration involve costs and bounds resources for a longer period of
   time? Yes. Well... then you see that is tough for the management to
   give the green light to such a shift given the complexity of the
   project and the fact that there is little interest for them to have
   a super fast state of the art system.

   So this is the general field you are playing in. On the one hand, it
   might be a bit demotivating for a person always interested in the
   last technological advances. On the other hand, it is interesting
   cause there is a lot to do and I believe that once you will grow
   your skills and gain confidence from the management by delivering
   successfull projects the management will allow yourself more room as
   they will trust your judgment relating to the second point:

   - Does the migration involve risk? Yes - but I am confident we can
     do it in a smooth way.

   as a reality. 

** On a trade-off

   Of course there are different trade-offs when designing your market
   risk systems.

   Depending on the types of instruments that your business deals with
   you might have risks that are more difficult to price and requires
   more heavy computational efforts.

   Think in this sense about complex derivatives with particular
   pay-offs.

   On the top of it your market risk model might use stronger and more
   rigid assumptions such as the delta-normal also called the
   J.P. Morgan RiskMetrics^TM methodology or more flexible approaches
   such as the full revaluation Monte-Carlo approaches mentioned in
   the paper.

   It is obvious then that you have a trade-off of accuracy
   vs. complexity of the system and you as a company have to decide
   where to position yourself on that curve.

   Note that you would ultimately see the curve trade-off twist in
   time due to the technological progress as well depicted in the
   paper.

   This leads me to the following goal-setting for myself in the industry.

* Goal-setting
  
   So your goal in this industry is to keep up with the technological
   change in order to stay always on the current line given the
   techonological progress.

   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/goalSet.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   We all know that due to the budget constrains, mind-set constrains,
   limited amount of time and the continuously moving curve - at a
   very high speed recently - it will be impossible to always lie on
   the line.

   Make sure at least that you are not to far off that line and
   convince your people by example that it is possible to stay close
   to the line with the correct attitute.

   Quite challenging but that will be the goal.
