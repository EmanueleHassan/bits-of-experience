#+END_COMMENT


So I am quickly checking into these for an interview. 

It will be in no way thorough or complete. 

It is just for me to get a rough idea about the topic such that you
will not fall out of a tree if the things are mentioned. 


{{{TEASER_END}}}

** IFRS 17

   These notes are based on the following: [[https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/insurance-contracts/ifrs-standard/ifrs-17-project-summary.pdf][link1]].

   Generally it holds:

   #+begin_quote
   IFRS 17 sets out the requirements that a company1 should apply in
   reporting information about insurance contracts it issues and
   reinsurance contracts it holds.
   #+end_quote

   The issues under the current set up are mainly the following:

   #+begin_quote
   (a) identify which groups of insurance contracts are profit making or
   loss making; and 

   (b) analyse trend information about insurance contracts
   #+end_quote

   IFRS 17 provides in this sense:

   #+begin_quote
   (a) provides *updated information* about the obligations, risks and
   performance of insurance contracts; 

   (b) increases *transparency* in financial information reported by
   insurance companies, which will give investors and analysts more
   confidence in understanding the insurance industry; and 

   (c) introduces *consistent accounting* for all insurance contracts
   based on a current measurement model. 
   #+end_quote

   IFRS 17 particularly aims to tackle long-term contracts with
   difficult to measure risk, for which there are no traded proxies on
   the market.

   Contracts that include a significant *deposit component* — an amount
   the insurer is obligated to pay the policyholder regardless of
   whether the insured event occurs.

   
*** Key Components in IFRS 17 reporting

    There are two essential components that you have to understand
    that are core to IFRS 17:

    #+begin_quote
    1. fulfilment cash flows
       
    the *current* estimates of amounts that the insurer expects to
    collect from premiums and pay out for claims, benefits and
    expenses, including an adjustment for the timing and risk of those
    cash flows;

    The measurement of the fulfilment cash flows reflects the current
    value of any /interest-rate guarantees/ and /financial options/
    included in the insurance contracts.

    Note that given the time value of money at each reporting date the
    fulfilment cash flow will be re-estimated and will vary accordingly.

    2. contractual service margin

    This represents the unearned profit that an entity expects to earn
    as it provides services.

    When applying IFRS 17, changes in the estimates of the expected
    premiums and payments that relate to *future* insurance coverage
    will adjust the expected profit—ie the contractual service margin
    for a group of insurance contracts will be increased or decreased
    by the effect of those changes. (*TODO*: understand that better)

    #+end_quote

    Such that it holds:

    #+end_export

    
*** Channels for Earning Profits

    This reflect the general insurance business. There is the usual
    split between profits from insurance service result (i.e. risk
    pooling) and profit from asset management - i.e. financial result
    that you get by investing the premiums in a smart way that matches
    your expected outflows duration etc.

    In general you have therefore the following categorization:

    #+begin_quote
    (a) the insurance service result, which depicts the profit earned
    from providing insurance coverage; 

    (b) the financial result, which captures: 

        (i) investment income from managing financial assets; and 

        (ii) insurance finance expenses from insurance obligations—the 
        effects of discount rates and other financial variables on the
        value of insurance obligations.
        I.e. financial movements on the liability side.
    #+end_quote

    With IFRS 17 it will be easier to account from which earning
    profits stream the profits are generating. It will therefore be
    easier to assess the way the insurance work under IFRS 17.
