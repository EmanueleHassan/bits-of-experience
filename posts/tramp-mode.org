This is possibly not even a post. Rather a quick entry but I like my
blog with the different tags to find the material quickly.

I started recently using tramp mode to ssh into some Raspberry devices
as I got some /TJbots/ to play with. 

I was aware that with tramp mode you could simply ssh into a file and
edit it from your local device, no /nano/ or such horrible programs
needed. Moreover you keep your IoT device thin as you don't have to
install any special software on it.

However, I was missing a proper shell on it. It turned out that if you
start an =eshell= while being sshed into a file on your IoT device
via tramp mode you will have your wonderful =eshell= written
completely in emacs and customizable according to your needs, with all
of the nice auto-completition on the top of it. 

There seems to be some overhead, as sometimes it reacts sluggishly
however this is hardly noticeable and a great way to work on remote
devices to my mind.
