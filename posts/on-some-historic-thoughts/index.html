So this is another personal post that is not related to the work.
</p>

<p>
It's Saturday today. Finally I had no plans for the day so that I am
taking the day to relax and reading a bit.
</p>

<p>
It is a nice activity as it enriches the soul and broadens the
horizons.
</p>

<p>
Today I took a book out of the shelves: <i>Secondhand Time: The Last of
the Soviets</i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Alexievich">Svetlana Aleksievich</a>.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
I do not recall why I bought this book.
</p>

<p>
I must have been in a library at some point and as it was back in the
days when I was reading Marx and was quite interested in the communist
thought and what happened back in the days. So I bought it.
</p>

<p>
I remember I read it back in the days. Back in 2014. I was impressed
by the book and by how rooted the soviet ideology was in the
interviewed people in the book.
</p>

<p>
I took it more as a historic book back in the days. I thought it was
over. I took it as a fascinating reading about the mixed feelings of
some people that lived the USSR. I took the people expressing some
nostalgia about some of the values the USSR was brining to the
individual as an interesting glimps into the mind of some nostalgic
people. 
</p>

<p>
I started reading it again today. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">recent events</a> I am reading
it with a different mind-set. I did not understand that the book was
talking very much about the present and not about the past.
</p>

<p>
When I was reading about the Afghanistan, Chechen and Georgian war I
just thought about it as a thing of the past. Something we have moved
away from.
</p>

<p>
I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
I am reading today about the people in the book talking about the
'special operation' in Chechenya almost 30 years after. About the
<i>contractors</i> in the wars. About the <i>zinc coffin</i> with the hermeitcal
closure. Sounds familiar right?
</p>

<p>
I started reading inteviews to Svetlana Aleksievich today. What she is
saying about the war in Ukraine. She understands the belly of Russia
better than thousand of people going into talk-shows.
</p>

<p>
She was right. She was expressing that feeling of anger against the
Nomenklatura that turned into the Oligarchs. She was expressing in the
book the <i>homo sovieticus</i> that did not die back in the days.
</p>

<p>
She was expressing the following - as well summed up in the interview
to <a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/03/15/we-were-wrong-to-think-totalitarianism-would-disappear-peacefully/">Israel Hayom</a> -:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"I don't doubt the role of the leader in history, but the main issue
goes deeper. The main problem is that the totalitarian tradition of
Communism didn't die. It nurtured people who lived within it for too
long and absorbed it [the tradition] in their souls. They didn't just
become slaves but romantics of slavery. They are still convinced that
the Soviet world was founded on justice and are striving to return to
how things were before."
</p>

<p>
"We are currently seeing before our eyes the collapse of the
totalitarian empire. We wanted to believe that Communism already died
30 years ago, but that was just wishful thinking. In the 90s we were
naïve and stuck with the belief that the people caused the revolution
against the Soviet regime. We were wrong. The people did not revolt
then against evil, the change was only led by a small group of the
intelligentsia, who gathered around the Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, and were supported by a thin layer of educated people. For
the Soviet people the change was too sudden, they did not absorb,
internalize or welcome the permutations.
</p>

<p>
"Later the people were impoverished, when public assets and natural
resources were divided between cronies, which led to them believing
that the entire transition from Soviet rule to freedom and democracy
was bad. The totalitarian mindset didn't die in those days, it's still
alive and kicking in Ukraine and among Ukrainians. These are the
convulsions of resistance to the collapse and the counterattack of
what I call 'Red Man,' the Soviet and the post-Soviet man who has not
disappeared anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"In the 1990s I worked on my book Secondhand Time and I travelled
across Russia to interview people. On my return to Moscow I told
friends and acquaintances: There is no connection between what's
happening among the educated elites of Moscow and what's bubbling in
the depths of Russia. My interlocutors didn't want to be
convinced. They preferred to think that in Belarus the grip of the
past of the Soviet tradition is maybe really strong, but in Russia the
processes of change in the direction of democratization are
irreversible. What a mistake this was. It's become clear that it's
possible to turn the wheel backwards. Since Putin's invasion of
Ukraine, the last free media outlets, which were still allowed to
exist in Russia one month ago, have been closed, censorship laws have
been passed, and essentially this country has again deteriorated into
an undisguised dictatorship."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So that is it. Just little thoughts. But there is a lesson learned in
it. 
</p>

<p>
Always read and expand your horizons. Maybe you will not be able to
appreciate something at a given moment. But it might leave you with
some kind of knowledge that will come to rescue at a later
stage. Making it possible for you to connect the dots and seeing the
bigger picture in a way that is not possible by simply living reading
the <i>latest news</i>.
</p>

<p>
A similar thing happened before the war when Russian troops where
starting to build up on the border of Ukraine. I recalled the
documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m76G2K19X8">winter on fire</a>. I understood back on the days what was
happening. If that happened in 2014 it was clear that the game was
big. You do not start to shoot at civilians with snipers killing more
than 100 of them if it would not be. It was clear back in the days
that the influence of Russia was big. That the interest is big.
