At the moment I have no time to make a nice sum up. 

I save here some useful links. 


Consider to come back and structure the post once you have
time. 

Finish first the post on RL... this alone should take quite some time
if you want to do it properly. It is in your org agenda. Capture file.

* Some useful resources

Best explaination in the world wide web for [[https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/][LSTM models architecture]].  

A good [[https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks][cheat sheet on RNN.]] On the website you can find other similar
scripts for other Neural Networks Architectures.
