The idea of wide column store is to extend the idea of RDBMS,
i.e. storing and managing data in tabular format, and to bring it into
the BigData world. 
</p>

<p>
This post will briefly address the different characteristics of
Hbase. I.e. it will first look at the logical idea for keeping data in
a tabular form in the big data world. It will then look at the
architecture behind Hbase and as you will see the basis for it is the
good old <i>master-slave</i> in parallel to HDFS that will be here used as
the storage layer.
</p>

<p>
Finally it will briefly address the physical storage layer.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2 id="org3e50fd7">On the logical Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e50fd7">
<p>
As we will see briefly HBase stores the data through HDFS. The idea of
Hbase and in general of wide-store technologies is to leverage big
data technologies to go away from the old SQL paradigm of having
multiple separate tables in Boyce-Codd normal form and joined through
their primary keys but rather to have a unified - very big table -
that represent the entire view of your business data and that are
handled directly using master-slave architecture and the HDFS
technology. 
</p>

<p>
The general idea is therefore: save everything in one big table; and
<b>save together was is accessed together</b>.
</p>

<br><br><style>
 {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
  padding: 0px;
}

/* Clearfix (clear floats) */
.row::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
</style>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img style="width:100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_14.09.41.png">

  <div class="column">
    <img style="width:100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_14.12.21.png">
</div>
</div>

<br><br><p>
Notice that in contrast to standard RDBMS where you had a limit on the
amount of columns it was possible to store - i.e. usually 256 - . In
this context the extent of the table is massively different so that
you can have millions of columns and billions of rows. You can get
easily to such numbers given the de-normalization process discussed.
</p>

<p>
The question is now clear that given the goal of storing together
material that is accessed together, we need a definition for the
latter. The idea in wide column store is that it is left to the user
to <b>specify column-families</b>, i.e. a group of columns that is usually
accessed together - say for instance booking and cancellation
records -.
</p>

<p>
Important is to underline that in contrast to the old SQL standard you
do not have to specify the schema fully in advance but you rather have
to specify the column-families of your wide-store. Individual columns
belonging to a column family might then be <b>added on the fly without
the need of specifying and creating a new table</b>.
</p>


<p>
The logical model would then look as follows:
</p>

<br><br><img width="60%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_14.27.00.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
Moreover notice that due to the denormalization such table is
typically very sparse.

<div id="outline-container-org75fce00" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org75fce00">Physical Layer Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org75fce00">
<p>
Given a basic understanding of the goal of wide-column store, we turn
to the physical level. 
</p>

<p>
Recall that the basis is the HDFS storage system and that you want to
store the content together which is accessed together.
</p>

<p>
The major two paradigm in this sense are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
row store
</p>

<p>
Here rows next to each other are stored together.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
column store
</p>

<p>
Here adjacent columns are stored together. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both have their merits. For instance in column store you might process
your data in an optimized way as there is generally a consistency in
the format of the data - i.e. all of type flot, int, string etc. -.
</p>

<p>
In contrast the row store might be beneficial for instance if data are
stored following some temporal structure so that data in a given time
frame are generally accessed together and lie close to each
other. I.e. in general if you index your data such that data that are
accessed together are stored together then the benefit of row store.
</p>

<p>
Wide-column store does not use any of the two methods but rather takes
a hybrid approach leveraging the two.
</p>

<p>
In this sense you store data by partitions, defined as a <code>set of
contiguous row-ids</code> (term: region); and its intercept with each
individual <code>column family</code>.
</p>

<p>
Important is however, the hierarchical way in which the data are
stored. Recall that the data are stored via HDFS so that data are
distributed among many different machines. 
</p>

<p>
Notice, that individual regions are stored on the same machine. This
means that you save in fact the different intersection among a single
region and the column families on the same machine. Different stores,
i.e. intercept of regions and column families are then stored in hdfs
blocks so that they might be accessed in a fast and independent way.
</p>

<br>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d94c6f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4d94c6f">Architecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4d94c6f">
<p>
Recall that as mentioned a couple of times the architecture is a
<i>master-slave</i> architecture that acts in parallel to HDFS. 
</p>

<p>
While HDFS manages the data block replication, update and retrieval
through its master <code>NameNode</code> and slave <code>DataNode</code>, Hbase master
(<code>HMaster</code>) manages the <code>data definition language</code> for your table;
i.e. the table creation, column family defintion, table deletion etc.,
assigning moreover regions to <code>RegionServers</code> (slaves). 
</p>

<p>
Notice that <code>RegionServers</code> are not responsible for storing the data
(i.e. its software implementation does not aim at that) cause this is
generally the task of the <code>DataNodes</code>. In fact the <code>RegionServer</code>
manages a set of regions (typically we have somewhere between ten to a
thousand regions per <code>RegionServer</code>). The <code>RegionServer</code> handles read
and write requests to the regions that it has loaded, and also splits
regions that have grown too large. I.e. the <code>RegionServer</code> directly
talks with the <code>DataNodes</code> to retrieve the data it is responsible for
and it also creates new regions if these grow to large.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore clear that due to the communication between the
<code>RegionServer</code> and the <code>DataNodes</code> it is a sensible decision to run
the <code>Datanode</code> saving the data of a particular region on the same
machine where the <code>RegionServer</code> is running. Like this you minimize
the network exchange and you save bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
Notice, that the <code>HMaster</code> assigns regions to the
<code>RegionServers</code>. There is however and important decision to be made by
the user, i.e. through which rule should you assign row-ids and by
product save data together?
</p>

<p>
The <b>trade-off</b> goes as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you want to access and withdraw data fast, think for instance to
BI-squads, than you want to save data that are accessed together and
you should therefore assign close <code>IDs</code> to such data.</li>

<li>if you want to make heavy lifting processing of the data, think for
instance at data science squads, then you might even prefer to save
data that are often accessed together separately, this in order to
leverage the parallelization of compute engines , think for instance
at <b>MapReduce</b> that is easy to run on wide-stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general structure would then look as follows:
</p>

<br><br><img width="60%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_15.41.04.png" class="center"><br><br><br>

<div id="outline-container-orgf6196ed" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf6196ed">Physical Layer Cont'd</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6196ed">
<p>
You have now a basic understanding of regions, column families,
stores, and the master and slaves nodes.
</p>

<p>
The question is now on how a single store is actually stored through
HDFS.
</p>

<p>
The idea is the following. 
</p>

<br><br><img width="60%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_15.46.30.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
I.e. you create <code>Hfiles</code>, which practically consists of <code>key-value</code>
pairs.
</p>

<p>
Here, 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keys = combination of logical table row-id and column family.</li>

<li>value = actually entry of the logical store.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In more detail each key-value pair would actually consist of the following
information:
</p>

<br><br><img width="60%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_15.51.44.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
Notice that while the general structure for the HFiles is logically
correctly represented as above; Hfiles actually operates in an even
more layered way, as we will see next.
</p>

<br>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org72a6c26" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org72a6c26">Hfile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org72a6c26">
<p>
The general structure of an Hfile would look as follows.
</p>

<br><br><img width="60%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-26_um_16.21.59.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
The idea is therefore that you would break an Hfile into several
<code>HBlocks</code> which would be saved on HDFS. You would then hold in the
<code>RegionServer</code> an index referring each key to an <code>Hblock ID</code> as in the
the image on the left on the left. Such index would be saved <b>in
memory</b> on the <code>RegionServer</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Given the necessity to look up a particular entry by the
<code>RegionServer</code> given a specific user request the process would then be
the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>look for the Hblock index in memory.</li>

<li>retrieve the <b>entire Hblock</b> from the Datnode.</li>

<li>access the desired entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notice then that the size of the Hblock is the size of the file that
will be opened in memory in the <code>RegionServer</code>. There is a price
between cost of seek of the file - if this is small - and a price in
the loading of the file into memory - if this is big -. There is
therefore again a <b>trade-off</b> and in the usual architecture you create
<b>64kb</b> Hblocks. Notice however that there might be deviations from the
number as a key-value pair is never allowed to be split and saved on
different Hblocks.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org658d92e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org658d92e">On the Append Only Issue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org658d92e">
<p>
Notice that given the above indexed structure and HBlock storage of
contiguous indexes if a user updates a record in the HBase logical
table changing the index of the data entries you would have to rewrite
the entire Hfile. Moreover given the <b>append only</b> nature of HDFS you
do not have the option of entering new records at positions of choice
in the document.
</p>

<p>
Given the above the architects of HBase went for the design of storing
modified or newly created HBase entries in memory on the
<code>RegionServers</code>. The idea is then the one of continuing to write on
this up until the memory of th machine is full and then to flush it by
writing a new <code>HFile</code> with sorted Key-value pairs while keeping the
old one.
</p>

<p>
In a next step you would then merge the <b>two</b> available <code>Hfiles</code>  into
a single one compacting the information of them.
</p>

<p>
This is the idea of <b>Log-Structured-Merge-Trees</b>
