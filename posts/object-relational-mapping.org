So basically the idea of object relational mapping is the one of
mapping relational tables to objects.

The idea is that a lot of times the application logic is in objects
while the persistency layer is in the relational schema.

That translation is annoying and time consuming. Plus it requires a
mind switch to think at the two different levels.

The idea of this technology was essentially to develop a framework to
map the relational persistency layer to the ORM paradigm. In such a
way it is possible for the developer to wire his mind into a single
setting - the one of the objects and to properly develop in a pure
object oriented mind.

In this sense this is a lot what is happening in the NoSQL space,
especially with the document store and the json communication format
for API.. the underlying driver must is the same.... avoid all of that
annoying conversions from one paradigm to the other.

So you see; always think in terms of drivers... you will anticipate
the future once you focus on the underlying driver and force instead
of on the concept itself.

In general much of these notes refer to the [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjbwuWh_eH4AhVDwQIHHW0vC9sQFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoclaptrinhdanang.com%2Fdownloads%2Fpdf%2Fspring%2FJava%2520Persistence%2520with%2520Hibernate.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0524Xl7sPIrS85z5EARMyP][following book]].

Note as well that as always you can debate about everything and you
shuold think when ORM and Hibernate - in the specific case - is a good
candidate and when not. See [[https://www.eversql.com/i-followed-hibernate-orm-to-hell-and-came-back-alive-to-tell-about-it/][this dude]] post in general - also check the
last section. There is interesting referenced material.

{{{TEASER_END}}}


** Important Concepts leading to ORM

   So this is very important.

   It must sit in a very important way in your brain.

   Cause this topic is very hot in the team and it is at least good
   that you have an understanding of going into one direction or the
   other.

   So interesting to see is that much of the topics discussed that
   follow come from thinking in terms of objects and the respective
   shortcoming when going 

   
*** Problem of Granularity

    The idea is that in the OOP world you have lots of level of
    granularity through which you can create and shape your objects.

    These are very important as through them you can create very
    sophisticated business logic.

    Now when working with SQL the point is essentially that such
    /level of granularity is lost/.

    It is generally not a big practice to work with =user-defined data
    types= in SQL relational DBs. You generally work at two level of
    granularity - tables and columns with the SQL standard data
    types. 

    The key now is essentially the following:

    #+begin_quote
Many simple persistence mechanisms fail to recognize this mismatch and
so end up forcing the less flexible representation of SQL products on
the object-oriented model, effectively flattening it.
    #+end_quote

**** TODO the book claims for a solution to the above problem - find it and integrate it here then.
   

*** The problem of Subtypes

    Essentially this is the problem of inheritance and polymorphism
    and the fact that there is no way to really express this into a
    relational database.

    This makes everything quite tricky.

    Essentially it is the following:

    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-07-05 180342.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    
*** The problem of Identity

    That is also quite an interesting one.

    The idea is of a radical difference among the identity principles
    in Java and the application side and on the relational DBs.

    The concept is that in Java you have two different concepts of
    identity:

    - == -> checking by reference 

    - .equals () -> checking by value

    While on the DB side you have the idea of checking by primary
    key for checking the uniqueness of a record.

    In this sense, understand as well the following concept that is
    related to the concept of identity:
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-07-06 090604.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    Note that this is very likely related to the idea of not setting
    any =setters= for the primary key columns in Hibernate. This is
    the same underlying idea.

    This is also why you also have an ID for the different tables and
    use ultimately that one. It is the way to implement that concept
    of /surrogate key/ and this is why Sergio was so focused on it in
    his introduction. I did not really get it properly to that stage. 
    

*** The problem of association

    Object-oriented languages represent associations using object
    references; but in the relational world, a /foreign key/ –constrained
    column represents an association, with copies of key values.

    The constraint is a rule that guarantees integrity of the
    association.  There are /substantial differences/ between the two
    mechanisms.

    Object references are /directional/. Navigation in a particular
    direction has no meaning for a relational data model because you
    can create arbitrary data associations with join and projection
    operators.

    The important thing is *the following* then:
        
    #+begin_quote
The challenge is to map a completely open data model, which is
independent of the application that works with the data, to an
application-dependent navigational model.
    #+end_quote

    
*** The problem of data navigation

    So basically when working with ORM it is important to keep the
    thing under control by not overloading the system with very
    expensive queries fetching all of the possible data relations
    across the object network in the mapped DB world.

    The idea is the one of leveraging /lazy loading/ as a solution as
    discussed a couple of times:

    #+begin_quote
    Any object persistence solution worth its salt provides
    functionality for fetching the data of associated instances only
    when the association is first accessed in Java code.  This is
    known as lazy loading: retrieving data on demand only.
    #+end_quote

    Note that this is not a trivial problem. Cause on the other side
    you have the following problem:

    #+begin_quote
This piecemeal style of data access is fundamentally inefficient [the
one of lazy loading] in the context of an SQL database, because it
requires executing one statement for each node or collection of the
object network that is accessed. This is the dreaded n+1 selects
problem - i.e. you actually perform too many queries killing the DB.
    #+end_quote

    So essentially you have the difficult problem:

    - avoid the *cartesian product* vs.  avoid *n+1 select* problem.
    
    Not trivial to solve and decide at development time. 


** On Mapping Strategies

*** On Entity and Value Types
    
    So one of the most important factors, is the difference between
    *entities and value types*. You have to understand when to map
    objects in the first and second way. This is of paramount
    importance. 

**** On Entity Types

     You have to make this difference explicit when you work in the ORM
     fashion. The main idea is the following:

     In the =entity type= all of the objects of interest reference a
     third *common* object: the =entity type=, i.e. an object that is
     equal in ==== java terms.
   
     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-09 152726.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     So here the key element that is important to understand is that the
     relation in the case of the =entity type=, i.e. a pointer in the
     JVM, is persisted as a reference in the DB, meaning a foreign
     key-constrained value.

     In this sense when the object is of =entity type= it is not
     deleted when one of the object pointing to it is. This is because
     of the idea that different object might use it and the idea that
     in DB schema behind there are two tables and there is a foreign
     key constraint. 


**** On Value Types
     
     Here the idea is that, there are object that do not have to be
     persisted as entity instance types as [[*On Entity Types][On Entity Types]], but rather
     *belong* to an entity type. 

     In this sense a =value type= has no persistent identifier
     property it is rather bounded to the entity type object it
     belongs to. When this is gone, the =value type= object is deleted
     as well.
     
     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-09 160450.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     
*** Mapping entities with identities

    We start now with modeling the =entities=, in later chapters we go
    then to the =value types=.

    The idea is that as soon as you have an =entity type= object you
    need an identifier for it.

    This because such entity types objects will actually form the
    basis for the tables to be persisted and they will need to contain
    the relevant primary keys.

    Hibernate as a framework also forces you behind the hood to work
    with surrogate keys as discussed. These should stay as such and
    should not turn into /natural keys/. This is important as
    experience showed that natural keys cause problems in the long run.

    In this sense when you create an =entity type=, you usually
    specify an =Id= property with a corresponding rule for setting
    it, say increase it etc. etc.

    Then once this is set you will never update it, so there will be
    *no setter*, rather just *getter* on it in order to get the
    desired value. 

    An example for it is the following:

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-10 094104.png" class="center">
    #+end_export
    
    Note now that the following general rules:

    #+begin_quote
if @Id is on a field, the JPA provider will access fields of the class
directly and consider all fields part of the persistent state by
default.
    #+end_quote

    #+begin_quote
Hibernate *doesn’t support updating primary key* values with an API; if
you try to work around this requirement, you’ll run into problems with
Hibernate’s caching and dirty-checking engine. If your database schema
relies on updatable primary keys (and maybe uses ON UPDATE CASCADE
foreign key constraints), you must change the schema before it will
work with Hibernate.
    #+end_quote

    Finally recall that it is important to get this right, as the
    general rule is:

    #+begin_quote
Expect your database schema to survive decades, even if your
application won’t.
    #+end_quote

**** How to generate surrogate keys effectively

     The starting point is the following:

     #+begin_quote
The @Id annotation is required to mark the identifier property of an
entity class. Without the @GeneratedValue next to it, the JPA
provider assumes that you’ll take care of creating and assigning an
identifier value before you save an instance.

JPA standardizes several value-generation strategies with the
javax.persistence.GenerationType enum, which you select with
@GeneratedValue(strategy = ...):
     #+end_quote

     Among the options are:

     - =GenerationType.AUTO=:

       Hibernate picks an appropriate strategy, asking the SQL dialect
       of your configured database what is best.
       
     - =GenerationType.SEQUENCE=:

       Sequential numeric values.

       Note the difference with the next one. I think the difference
       lies in the /sequence/. A sequence can be quite general and
       does not have to be the +1 sequence. In fact there are lower
       level stuff happening depending on the SQL dialect you are
       working with. 
       
     - =GenerationType.IDENTITY=:

       special auto-incremented primary key column that automatically
       generates a numeric value on INSERT.
       
     - =GenerationType.TABLE=:

       Here you will have an extra table in your DB schema that holds
       the numeric primary key value, one row for each entity
       class. This table will be read and updated accordingly, before
       INSERTs. The default table name is HIBERNATE_SEQUENCES with
       columns SEQUENCE_NAME and SEQUENCE_NEXT_HI_VALUE. 

       



**** How to name your tables

     #+begin_src java
@Entity 
@Table(name = "USERS") 
public class User implements Serializable { 
 // ...
}
     #+end_src

     Note that by default if you do not specify a name the name is
     specified according to the Object the Entity annotation is
     bounded to.

     Note now that the above is a good example, as the User entity
     would map to the USER table; this is a reserved keyword in most
     SQL DBMSs. You can’t have a table with that name, so you instead
     map it to USERS.

     There are then tricks in order to generally deal with reserved
     keywords. Skip it for now. There are as well ways to enforce
     naming convetions across your tables names. 
     

**** Naming Entities for Querying

     The idea is that:

     #+begin_quote
all entity names are automatically imported into the namespace of the
query engine.

In other words, you can use short class names *without a package prefix*
in JPA query strings.
     #+end_quote

     Note now that if you have two entity classes named in the *same
     way* in *two different packages* then you need to rename one of
     them for JPA - through the name property as above - if you want
     to continue using the short form queries, such as:

     #+begin_src java
     List result = em.createQuery("select i from Item i")
      .getResultList();
     // where Item is the shortname and is an Entity in Hibernate
     #+end_src

     
**** Dynamic SQL generation

     Here the idea is

     #+begin_quote
     By default, Hibernate creates SQL statements for each persistent
     class when the persistence unit is created, on startup. These
     statements are simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
     operations for reading a single row, deleting a row, and so on.
     #+end_quote

     So the idea is that such statements are stored in memory instead
     of being generated on the fly. This is computationally cheaper.

     The tricky bit comes with the =UPDATE= statements.

     #+begin_quote
     After all, the columns to be updated aren’t known at this time. The
     answer is that the generated SQL statement updates all columns, and if
     the value of a particular column isn’t modified, the statement sets it
     to its old value.  In some situations, such as a legacy table with
     hundreds of columns where the SQL statements will be large for even
     the simplest operations (say, only one column needs updating), you
     should disable this startup SQL generation and switch to dynamic
     statements generated at runtime.

     An *extremely large number of entities* can also impact startup
     time, because Hibernate has to generate all SQL statements for
     CRUD up front.  Memory consumption for this query statement cache
     will also be high if a dozen statements must be cached for
     thousands of entities. This can be an issue in virtual
     environments with memory limitations, or on low-power devices.
     #+end_quote 

     So keep these points in the back of the mind when creating your
     Hibernate instances.
     
     In order to disable such default behaviour you can use the
     following:

     #+begin_src java
@Entity 
@org.hibernate.annotations.DynamicInsert
@org.hibernate.annotations.DynamicUpdate
public class Item {
 // ... 
}
     #+end_src

     
**** Immutable types

     There might be objects which logic is *immutable*.

     Think for instance a Bid in an auction. Once it is there, it is
     there, you cannot modify it.

     You can specify this immutable property as follows:

     #+begin_src java
@Entity
@org.hibernate.annotations.Immutable
public class Bid {
 // ...
}
     #+end_src

     Then you will never be able to execute =UPDATE= statements on
     such table.
     

*** Mapping Value Types Objects

    Let's start again with the key point; this is fundamental as if
    you fail here, you will fail in your DB design.

    This is the following:

    #+begin_quote
- Entities are the coarser-grained classes of your system. Their
  instances have an independent life cycle and their own identity, and
  many other instances can reference them.

- Value types, on the other hand, are dependent on a particular entity
  class. A value type instance is bound to its owning entity instance,
  and only one entity instance can reference it; it has no individual
  identity
    #+end_quote

    So that is the big difference that you have to make when working
    with objects. Objects that are a property of an entity type,
    belong to =value types=.

    So, far when talking about =value types= we made the explicit
    connection to embedded objects as discussed above.

    Note that it is not important if the Object is programmer-defined
    or coming from some standard library. Everything embedded within
    an Entity Object is a =value type= Object.

    So basically, the book starts with the /Numeric Objects/ in the
    Java language and other very common data Objects through which you
    implement the basics of any program. It shows how these are
    converted to SQL data types. You can read this online when needed.

    More interesting are the following concepts:

**** =transient= keyword

     this is used to mark properties of the Object of interest that
     should be discarded; meaning not persisted.

     This will allow you to implement some cool application logic.

     #+begin_src java
     class Ob {
	 // ...

	 @javax.persistence.Transient
	     Integer myTransientInteger;
	
	 // ...
     }

     #+end_src

**** non-optional

     When you mark a property with this tag it will be marked as =NOT
     NULL= in the DB schema.

     #+begin_src java
     class Ob {
	 // ...

     @Basic(optional = false)
     BigDecimal initialPrice;
    
	 // ...
     }


     #+end_src

     Another option in this sense is to include this in the =@Column=
     property.

     #+begin_src java
     class Ob {
	 // ...

	 @Column(nullable = false, name = "BlaBla") // so you see. You can as well name the column.
	 BigDecimal initialPrice;

	 // Note that Column has as well parameters for controlling the schema and catalog properties.

	 // ...
     }
     #+end_src
     
     Finally there is the way of working with =@NotNull=, this will
     make the thing not-nullable through Bean Validation. I.e. at
     runtime you will get errors.

     You will not have the not-null property in your DB schema. So it
     depends what you want to do. However, in general it is not
     recommended to do any of this.
     
**** On @Embedded classes

     Basically recall that depending on where you set the =@Id=
     property:

     - either on a field

     - or on a getter

     then this will be the strategy for reading and writing from the
     DB.

     Now =@Embedded= classes are the actual =value types= objects you
     write.

     That said, they will inherit the mapping strategy for reading and
     writing of the =entity types= objects they are bounded to.

     In case you want to override such a strategy you can use the
     =@Access= annotation. This can be both at class level or at
     property level within the embedded class.

     Note that when you embedd a class you are actually augmenting the
     relevant table with all of the relevant fields.

     Note that you might want to override the =equals= and =hashCode=
     cause you have to start comparing by values and not by reference.

     An important thing to remember when working in such a way is the
     one of overriding embedded attributes. This is important as you
     might have for instance two addresses and if you do not override
     the respective names you would have conflicts and you could not
     work in the same table. 

     #+begin_src java
      @Entity
      @Table(name = "USERS")
      public class User implements Serializable {

	  @Embedded
	  @AttributeOverrides({
		  @AttributeOverride(name = "street",
				     column = @Column(name = "BILLING_STREET")),
		      @AttributeOverride(name = "zipcode",
					 column = @Column(name = "BILLING_ZIPCODE", length = 5)),
		      @AttributeOverride(name = "city",
					 column = @Column(name = "BILLING_CITY"))
		      })

		      protected Address billingAddress; 

     // ...

     }
     #+end_src

     You can then check at the book. You can as well have nested relations.
     
**** Derived properties

      So basically in this way you can apply transformations *when
      fetching* the object from the database.

      #+begin_src java
@org.hibernate.annotations.Formula(
 "substr(DESCRIPTION, 1, 12) || '...'"
)
protected String shortDescription;
@org.hibernate.annotations.Formula(
 "(select avg(b.AMOUNT) from BID b where b.ITEM_ID = ID)"
)
protected BigDecimal averageBidAmount;
      #+end_src

      Note that this is just for reading. =ColumnTransformer=
      described in the next section is both for reading and writing. 
      
**** Transforming column values

      You can apply transformations for reading and writing from/in
      the database as follows:

      #+begin_src java
@Column(name = "IMPERIALWEIGHT")
@org.hibernate.annotations.ColumnTransformer(
 read = "IMPERIALWEIGHT / 2.20462",
 write = "? * 2.20462"
)
protected double metricWeight;
      #+end_src

      Note that such transformations are as well applied in DB
      queries restrictions.

      Think for instance at the following:

      #+begin_src  java
      List<Item> result =
       em.createQuery("select i from Item i where i.metricWeight = :w")
       .setParameter("w", 2.0)
       .getResultList();

      // The actual SQL executed by Hibernate for this query contains the
      // following restriction in the WHERE clause: ...
      where
       i.IMPERIALWEIGHT / 2.20462=?
      #+end_src

      Note that you will not be able to use *indices* on such queries
      restrictions. This because all of the values will have to be
      calculated. This will cause in fact a /full table scan/, because
      the values have to be calculated for all rows before evaluating
      the restriction.

      So you see you have pro and cons when working with
      Hibernate. There are things you should consider as well. 

      
***** TODO understand if you can implement this as well with a setter and reader

      theoretically you can as well make the transformation there.

      double check but I think that it is possible and like this you
      will decrease the amount of tools that you are actually using. 
    

    

**** Generating Values

     With this tag you can Hibernate can automatically generate the
     values for the fields when interacting with the Database.

     #+begin_src java
     @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
     @Column(insertable = false, updatable = false) // note both false, meaning just the DB can generate them. User cannot.
     @org.hibernate.annotations.Generated(
					  org.hibernate.annotations.GenerationTime.ALWAYS
					  )
	 protected Date lastModified;
     @Column(insertable = false)
     @org.hibernate.annotations.ColumnDefault("1.00")
	 @org.hibernate.annotations.Generated(
					      org.hibernate.annotations.GenerationTime.INSERT
					      )
	 protected BigDecimal initialPrice;
     #+end_src

     This is convenient for instance for generating timestamps for the
     insertion into the DB.

     Note the following:

     #+begin_quote
      With ALWAYS, Hibernate refreshes the entity instance after every
      SQL UPDATE or INSERT
     #+end_quote

**** Enumerator

     Note that this is important when working with Enumerators
     Objects.

     If you wod not work with this property then you will save the
     ordinal position of the value of within the enumerator.

     In order to perform transactions with the enumerator label you
     should use the =EnumType.STRING= option.

     #+begin_src java
     @NotNull
     @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
     protected AuctionType auctionType = AuctionType.HIGHEST_BID;
     #+end_src
     
**** String

     Note that Strings are mapped ot VARCHAR(255) by default. If you
     do not want this default but rather a different value you have to
     set it in the =length= paramter.


*** Mapping Inheritance

    This is an important concept as here is where things get
    tricky.

    The tricky business is always the same, you start to have OOP
    concepts such as polymorphism and the way you map such OOP
    characterstics into your relational tables is a non-trivial task
    that requires a bit of thinking.

    Essentially you have 4 possibilties, depending on the structure of
    your application logic you might want to go for the one or the
    other.

    We will explore them further next, before let's quickly dive in
    the concepts of =polymorphic associations= and =polymorphic
    queries=. These are essential cause you have to think what you get
    from working in one way or the other.
    
**** Polymorphic Associations

     So here the idea is the following:

     #+begin_quote
A polymorphic association consists on two (or more) associations
happening with the same foreign key.
     #+end_quote

     Such that if =polymorphic_association = true= you essentially
     have repsected the superclass-subclass relations in your DB.

     You would essentially have a table mapping to the superclass and
     then it is clear that if you have different tables for your
     subclasses that will reference the superclass via the foreign key
     you would have a polymorphic association and with the key of the
     superclass you will be able to fetch all of the relevant
     associations in the subclasses.

     You will see that depending on the mapping strategy this is not
     always achieved and you should consider if it is fine to you or
     not. 


**** Polymorphic Queries

     Think again in terms of OOP.

     The idea when working with ORM is the concept of working always
     with Objects when working in the relational space.

     In JPA you have as well ways to query your data and fetch the
     relevant information through APIs built around Objects mapped to
     the relational space.

     The idea of polymorphic queries is the following then:

     #+begin_quote
The *from* clause of a query includes not only instances of the
specific entity class to which it refers, but all subclasses of that
class as well. The instances returned by a query include instances of
the subclasses that satisfy the query conditions.
     #+end_quote
     

**** General set up for the following exercise

     Note that in the following we will discuss mapping strategies for
     the BillingDetails and its subclasses.

     The general set up for it is the following:

     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-17 113654.png" class="center">
     #+end_export


**** One table per concrete class with implicit polymorphism

     So this is the first possibility.

     Note that the name given in the book is not that intuitive for
     the concept behind it.

     What you are actually doing here according to my opinion is
     ultimately /breaking the polymorphism/. You actually see it by
     the fact that in this mapping strategy you actually do not have
     /polymorphic associations/ and the possibility of performing
     /polymorphic queries/.

     The conceptual idea in this kind of mapping is the following:

     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-17 112758.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     So you see that there is no table for the superclass but rather
     its properties are persisted within the respective two tables
     mapping to the subclasses.

     You actually implement the above in the following way:

     #+begin_src java
     @MappedSuperclass // IMPORTANT; include this in the superclass
		       // otherwise the properties of the superclass will
		       // not be PERSISTED to the subclasses-entity models
     public abstract class BillingDetails {
	 @NotNull
	 protected String owner;
	 // ...
     }

     // Subclass table, extending superclass and being mapped through the
     // Entity tag.
     @Entity
     @AttributeOverride(name = "owner",  // need to change name otherwise
					 // possible conflicts when
					 // evolving your schema
			column = @Column(name = "CC_OWNER",nullable = false))
     public class CreditCard extends BillingDetails {
	 @Id
	 @GeneratedValue(generator = Constants.ID_GENERATOR)
	 protected Long id;
	 @NotNull
	 protected String cardNumber;
	 @NotNull
	 protected String expMonth;
	 @NotNull
	 protected String expYear;
	 // ...
     }
     #+end_src


     Let's reason now around:

     - polymorphic associations:

       So it is clear that here there is no polymorphic
       association. All subclasses are mapped to different tables such
       that there might not be an association to their superclass that
       can be represented by a single foreign key relation.

     - polymorphic queries:

       note that this is also not possible.

       If you want to query upon the field of the superclass, here the
       owner property you should make *multiple* queries - one for
       each concrete subclass.


**** One table per concrete class with unions

     So here the essential idea is to have at the relational level the
     same schema as above.

     The difference lies in the fact that in order to apply your
     polymorphic operations at the superclass level you do not have to
     make separate queries, fetch the results and merge them at
     runtime in your java application as in the previous case.

     You can rather apply directly *ploymorphic queries* and let your
     database optimizer actually find the best execution plan.

     In order to work in such a way you can use the following:

     #+begin_src java
     // Note here the entity tag and the inheritancetype TABLE_PER_CLASS.
     // Note as well that actually no table for the superclass is
     // created. As mentioned the schema is the same as in the previous
     // section.
     @Entity
     @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
     public abstract class BillingDetails {

	 @Id
	 @GeneratedValue(generator = Constants.ID_GENERATOR)
	 protected Long id;
	 @NotNull

	 protected String owner;
	 // ...

     }
     #+end_src


     The subclasses would then look as usual. Simply extending the
     superclass above.

     As mentioned this would allow polymorphic queries; such that
     writing queries as:

     #+begin_src sql
     select bd from BillingDetails bd

     ---- would be translated by the Hibernate engine behind the scenes into:

     select
     ID, OWNER, EXPMONTH, EXPYEAR, CARDNUMBER,
     ACCOUNT, BANKNAME, SWIFT, CLAZZ_
     from
     ( select
     ID, OWNER, EXPMONTH, EXPYEAR, CARDNUMBER,
     null as ACCOUNT,
     null as BANKNAME,
     null as SWIFT,
     1 as CLAZZ_           -- note this that classifies which table the results come from
     from
     CREDITCARD
     union all
     select
     id, OWNER,
     null as EXPMONTH,
     null as EXPYEAR,
     null as CARDNUMBER,
     ACCOUNT, BANKNAME, SWIFT,
     2 as CLAZZ_           -- note this that classifies which table the results come from
     from
     BANKACCOUNT
     ) as BILLINGDETAILS
     #+end_src
     

**** One table per class hierarchy

     Here the mapping strategy would result in the following:

     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-17 143159.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     So essentially here the idea is the following:

     #+begin_quote
You can map an entire class hierarchy /to a single table/. This table
includes columns for all properties of all classes in the
hierarchy.

The value of an extra type *discriminator column* or formula identifies
the concrete subclass represented.
     #+end_quote

     Understand now the merits and drawbacks:

     - On the good side.

       #+begin_quote
This mapping strategy is a winner in terms of both performance and
simplicity.

It’s the best-performing way to represent polymorphism—both
polymorphic and non-polymorphic queries perform well—and it’s even
easy to write queries by hand.

Ad hoc reporting is possible without complex joins or unions. Schema
evolution is straightforward.
       #+end_quote

       Note that polymorphic queries are straightforward as in the
       specific case the =owner= is just a field. It is
       straightforward to apply =selection= and get all of the desired
       results of, among the others, the subclasses.

     - Issues:

       #+begin_quote
       There is *first major issue*: data integrity.

       You must declare columns for properties declared by subclasses
       to be nullable. If your subclasses each define several
       non-nullable properties, the loss of NOT NULL constraints may
       be a serious problem from the point of view of data
       correctness.

       Imagine that an expiration date for credit cards is required,
       but your database schema can’t enforce this rule because all
       columns of the table can be NULL. A simple application
       programming error can lead to invalid data.

       There is *second major issue*: normalization.

       You’ve created *functional dependencies* between non-key
       columns, *violating the third normal form*.

       As always, denormalization for performance reasons can be
       misleading, because it sacrifices *long-term stability*,
       *maintainability*, and the *integrity of data*.

       This is important as well. Before starting to design your DB
       you should properly think about what normal form you want to
       reach such that you will make sure that in the long run
       maintainability will not be a major concern.

       #+end_quote

       Should you want to go for this mapping strategy you can
       implement it in Hibernate as follows:

       #+begin_src java
       @Entity
       @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE) // on the root class.
       @DiscriminatorColumn(name = "BD_TYPE")                // this is a
       // discriminator
       // column
       // distinguishing
       // among the
       // subclasses
       public abstract class BillingDetails {

	   @Id
	   @GeneratedValue(generator = Constants.ID_GENERATOR)
	   protected Long id;

	   @NotNull
	   @Column(nullable = false)
	   protected String owner;
	   // ...
       }

       // Example of subclass - see the discriminator value that you set
       // here.
       @Entity
       @DiscriminatorValue("CC") 
       public class CreditCard extends BillingDetails {

	   @NotNull                        // Hibernate ignores the @NotNull
					   // for schema DDL generation, but
					   // it observes it at runtime
	   protected String cardNumber;

	   @NotNull
	   protected String expMonth;

	   @NotNull
	   protected String expYear;

	   // ...

       }
       #+end_src

       A final point that is worth to mention is the following:

       #+begin_quote
       Sometimes, especially in legacy schemas, you don’t have the freedom to
       include an extra discriminator column in your entity tables. In this
       case, you can apply an expression *to calculate* a discriminator value
       for each row.
       #+end_quote

       You can do that in the following way:

       #+begin_src java
       // on the superclass
       @Entity
       @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
       @org.hibernate.annotations.DiscriminatorFormula(
						       "case when CARDNUMBER is not null then 'CC' else 'BA' end"
						       )

	   public abstract class BillingDetails {

	       // ...

	   }
       #+end_src


**** One table per subclass

     This is actually the most straightforward way.

     The concept is that you keep all the OOP hierarchy as is and you
     leverage foreign keys constraints in your relational schema that
     would ultimately enforce the OOP hierachy logic.
     
     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-17 160331.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     If you persist on a subclass object, Hibernate inserts two
     rows. The values of properties declared by the superclass are
     stored in a new row of the /BILLINGDETAILS/ table. Only the
     values of properties declared by the subclass are stored in a new
     row of the /CREDITCARD/ table.

     The primary advantage of this strategy is that it *normalizes* the
     SQL schema.  Schema evolution and integrity-constraint
     definition are straightforward.

     Note that performace can become slow with this relational schema
     design. This due to the multiple join across many tables. 

     This is good as with it you can reach the normal form you desire
     and this should guarantee the needed consistency in the long
     run. 

     In order to implement this mapping strategy in Hibernate you
     should work as follows:

     #+begin_src java
     @Entity
     @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
     public abstract class BillingDetails {

	 @Id
	 @GeneratedValue(generator = Constants.ID_GENERATOR)
	 protected Long id;

	 @NotNull
	 protected String owner;

	 // ...

     }

     // Subclass
     @Entity
     @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "CREDITCARD_ID") // specify PFK to join
						   // on. If you do not
						   // specify anything it
						   // will be called ID.
     public class CreditCard extends BillingDetails {

	 @NotNull
	 protected String cardNumber;

	 @NotNull
	 protected String expMonth;

	 @NotNull
	 protected String expYear;

	 // ...

     }


     #+end_src

     A *polymorphic query* would then be implemented via an outer
     join.

     If you see the joins - think about the situation in the
     applications you are working on, then you see that this mapping
     strategy is more difficult to implement by hand — even ad hoc
     reporting is more complex. This is an important consideration if
     you plan to mix Hibernate code with /handwritten SQL/ - which
     will for sure be the case in the case of legacy applications as
     ours.

     
**** On mixing mapping strategies

     It is possible to mix among the mapping strategies discussed
     above.

     This for instance to get around some downsides of a mapping
     strategy; say for instance go from a table per subclass - with
     union - to a normalized table-per-subclass strategy. 

     Or for instance, you could have a single table with a particular
     subclass in a separate table with a foreign key relation - such
     that the /not null/ restriction of the single table does not have
     to be. For instance:
     
     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-08-18 085954.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     You can achieve the above by:

     - using the =InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE= in the superclass

     - use the following annotation in the relevant subclass that you
       do not want to include in the single table

     #+begin_src java
     @Entity
     @DiscriminatorValue("CC")  // as in single table strategy
     @SecondaryTable(           // here you specify a secondary table where
				// this object should be persisted
		     name = "CREDITCARD",
		     pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "CREDITCARD_ID") // PFK
		     )

     public class CreditCard extends BillingDetails {

	 @NotNull
	 @Column(table = "CREDITCARD", nullable = false) // here you
							 // specify the
							 // table where to
							 // persiste the
							 // property
	 protected String cardNumber;

	 @Column(table = "CREDITCARD", nullable = false)
	  protected String expMonth;

	 @Column(table = "CREDITCARD", nullable = false)
	 protected String expYear;
	 // ...
     }
     #+end_src
    

**** Choosing a Mapping strategy

     Here are some general guidelines from the book - quite intuitive
     if you know the couple of principles behind it:

     - If you don’t require polymorphic associations or queries, lean
       toward table-per-concrete class.

       Here always go with the explicit UNION-based mapping with
       =InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS= should be preferred, because
       (optimized) polymorphic queries and associations will then be
       possible later.

       Probably this will never be the case, otherwise you will not
       use such OOP structure in the first place.

     - If you do require polymorphic associations or queries, and
       subclasses declare relatively few properties lean toward
       =InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE=.

       This especially so if the main difference among subclasses is
       their behaviour rather than their fields.

       Here the main point is to convince yourself that *denormalized
       schema* will not create any issues in the long run.

     - If you do require polymorphic associations or queries, and
       subclasses declare many *(non-optional)* properties lean toward
       =InheritanceType.JOINED=. 


**** On the order in which to think the ORM

     Another open point that I am noting while writing is the
     following: so far it is not clear if you should first think your
     application in terms of Objects and then decide how to map it
     into the DB or vice versa.

     You will see this with the experice. It looks to me as if the
     whole point of using such framework is as well a little bit to
     think first in terms of objects, then decide for a proper mapping
     strategy but then once this is done, you can as well forget the
     DB and work again at application layer.


**** TODO possibly add section on polymorphic associations

     not so well explained in the book. I think it is not conceptually
     strucutred in the correct way. This section in the book is a bit
     out of scope. 

     Continue reading and then make sense of how to structure your
     notes in this dimension. 


*** TODO Start mapping exercise - the longrunning component

    check at it once Johannes is back.

    You can start to work in ORM way in this component.
