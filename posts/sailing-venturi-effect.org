So I have to render my sailing notes digital.

Otherwise I will loose them in time and I will not be able to withdraw
them in the future anymore.

So this is a legacy stuff migration.

By now I do everything digitally and everything flows directly more
less into this blog such that I can archive and withdraw it.

In the past it did not used to be the case and now you are paying the
price for it. You want to pay it though as sailing is supposed to be
your main leisure in the coming decades such that it makes sense to
organize your material relating to it.

So this post treats the venturi-effect. This is the ultimate effect
why you are able to sail against the wind and still move in the
direction where the wind is coming.

It is also the same effect that planes use to take off and stay high
up in the air. Helicopters also use it as well.

So it is a nice concept to understand also when you fly and highly in
use in lots of this mechanical physics based stuff.

* Bernoulli and Venturi Effect

  So basically the two say the same stuff - at least when I read
  wikipedia.

  Do not want to loose too much time being very formal here.

  But basically the idea is the following:

  Bernoulli's principle Bernoulli's principle states that an increase
  in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in
  static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential
  energy. (Wikipedia)

  The Venturi effect is the reduction in fluid pressure that results
  when a fluid flows through a constricted section (or choke) of a
  pipe. (Wikipedia)

  So they state essentially the same stuff and it makes also intuitive
  sense checking at the image - i.e. my common sense would have
  expected something like that.

  Now given the understaning of this principle it will be possible for
  you to understand the idea of the sails.

* Sailing basic principle

  In order to understand it - consider the following picture:
  
  #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/bernoulli.gif" class="center">
  #+end_export

  Given the above you will have two forces resulting on your sail:
  
  #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/liftdrag.jfif" class="center">
  #+end_export

  The resulting force will be a vector in between.

  That is the resulting vector pushing your boat forward.

  It it clear now why you cannot sail completely upwind... need to
  have the wind properly cutting your sails.

  Note now that in sailing boats you double this effect down by
  playing with multiple sails.

  Consider the following image:
  
  #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/sail_bernoulli.jpg" class="center">
  #+end_export

  You see that the jibe will help to make the pressure on the higher
  part of the main sail even lower by pushing even more air into
  there.

  This will make the difference in pressure even higher and augment
  the lift on the main.

  Note that there are two effects - the smaller the distance between
  the sail and the narrower the passage of air will increase as well
  the velocity on the inner-side of jib decreasing its effect.

  The benefit of the main is likely higher and this is why it works.

  I mean the last part is a construct of mine. Would have to test it
  empirically... maybe there is sufficient space but I guess this is
  the reason why there is not always an added benefit in trimming the
  sails or adding a further sail - say for instance the Mizzen
  Staysail that people declare more useful for boat stabilization
  rathere than power increase.
