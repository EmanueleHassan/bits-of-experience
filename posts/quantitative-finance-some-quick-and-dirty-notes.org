   So recently I had an interview for a quantitative finance
   position. I completely failed the preparation as it was not at all
   about financial instruments but much more about econometrics.

   Anyways, here the notes I did for this preparation session. I
   mainly prepared following [[https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/finance/the-50-market-risk-interview-questions-you-need-to-anticipate][these notes]] as I was told that one of the
   interviewer would be of the market risk division.

   In fact, it turned out that this is a super nice team but is much
   more about times series and econometrics than classical market risk
   theory as you are being taught in University.

   {{{TEASER_END}}}


* Some Mathematical Definitions

  - Cointegration:

    First, all of the series must be integrated of *order d* (see
    Order of integration).

    Next, if a linear combination of this collection is integrated of
    order less than d, then the collection is said to be
    co-integrated.

#+begin_export html
 <img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-17_um_09.19.20.png" class="center">
#+end_export

    For integrated I (1) processes, Granger and Newbold showed that
    de-trending does not work to eliminate the problem of spurious
    correlation, and that the superior alternative is to check for
    co-integration.

    usual procedure for testing hypotheses concerning the relationship
    between non-stationary variables was to run ordinary least squares
    (OLS) regressions on data which had been differenced. This method
    is biased if the non-stationary variables are cointegrated.

  - P-value:
    
    In null hypothesis significance testing, the p-value is the
    probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the
    results actually observed, under the assumption that the null
    hypothesis is correct.

  - Stationarity: this is a needed characteristics of times series
    that makes them tractable from a statistical point of view. It
    guarantees that there are some traits that guarantee a certain
    stability of the series such that it is possible to arrive at
    statistical conclusion.

    + Weak stationarity: if the process moments are stable over
      multiple time horizons. I.e. time shifts do not change the first
      couple of moments

    + Strong stationarity: if the process follows the same
      distribution under time shifts. Difficult if not impossible to
      check in practice. 

  - Goodness of Fit: it is a measure how well a statistical model fits
    a set of observations.

    You can then use for instance information criteria, R^2 for
    regression etc.

  - Regression:

    is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships
    between a *dependent variable* (often called the 'outcome
    variable') and *one or more independent variables* (often called
    'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').

    You can then have different types of regression:

    - linear regression

    - generalized linear regression

    - non-parametric regression

  - Risk-neutral:

    There are the three components: Risk Adverse, Risk Neutral and
    Risk Lover. The utility function of the investor defines his risk
    appetite. In finance and economics you usually assert that the
    investors are risk-adverse.

    Then because of this it becomes difficult to price
    securities. However in this sense the fundamental theorem of
    arbitrage is helpful. This together with risk-neutrality allows to
    price securities in a meaningful way.

    As if there is no risk in the investment, due to the fundamental
    theorem of asset pricing you cannot make any arbitrage,
    i.e. profit without taking any risk. I.e. you must earn the risk
    free rate. Like this you can price stuff.

     
* Different Types of Risk

  - Credit Risk

  - Market Risk

  - Liquidity Risk

  - Operational Risk
  
* Quantitative Risk

  At city they have the following divisions:
  
  - Market Risk Analytics

  - Counterparty Risk Analytics

  - Credit Risk Analytics

  - Economic Forecasting

  - Risk Capital Analytics

  - Model Governance and Stress Testing

* Questions
  
** Risk Measures


*** VaR

   1. What is Value at Risk:

     Value at Risk is defined as the percentile of a return
      distribution.

     In the 95%-VaR you would compute the maximum loss you would get
      in 95% of the cases given the return distribution.

     VaR can be calculated in two ways:

      1. using the historic return distribution. you would then compute
	 the 5% quantile based on such historic return distribution. 

      2. using a parameteric approach. You would define a parametric
	 distribution for the returns. You would then compute the
	 percentile of interest of it. If loss is normally distributed
	 then you know that it is the usual formula. You can also use
	 some more fancy solutions such as Cornish-Fisher Approximation
	 where you do a tailor expansion.

   2. What is wrong with VaR:

      1. It does not take into account what happens in the tails after the
	 VaR quantile. For instance a distribution might have a big event
	 in there and another not. Both same VaR but obviously one is more
	 risky than the other.

      2. It does not satisfy the sub-additivity property of *coherent
         risk measures*.

	 The sub-additivity property says that a risk measure p it
         must hold

	 #+begin_example
	p (X) + p (Y) >= p (X + Y)
	 #+end_example
  
	 I.e. it ensures that merging positions decreases the risk.

	 This is not guaranteed by the VaR. So that aggregating risk
         does not reduce risk. On the contrary *risk might be reduced
         by splitting positions*.

	 I.e. even if all of your LOB satisfy VaR capital requirements,
	 your overall business does not.

   
      3. What is *non-linear VaR*:

	  *Here the idea is essentially that the loss does not react
         in a linear way to movements of the underlying*.

	  This often comes in the case of derivatives, where you have
         non-linearity in movements such as price etc. See *the
         greeks* in this sense.

	  The nonlinearity of certain derivatives leads to nonlinear
         risk exposures in the VaR of a portfolio.
       
	  Nonlinearity can be witnessed in the payoff diagram of a
         plain vanilla call option. The payoff diagram has a strong
         positive convex payoff profile before the option's expiration
         date, with respect to the stock price.

	  When the call option reaches a point where the option is in
         the money, it reaches a point where the payoff becomes
         linear. Conversely, as a call option becomes increasingly out
         of the money, the rate at which the option loses money
         decreases until the option premium is zero.

	  #+begin_quote
	  Given such complex dynamics it makes sense to calulate the
	  VaR using Monte Carlo VaR simulations of options pricing
	  models to estimate the VaR of the portfolio.
	  #+end_quote

	 1. Challenges of calculating VaR for a *mixed portfolio*?

	    The model becomes complex as there are potentially tons of
            factors affecting each other. Very different /channels of
            transmission/.

	    We might well have models to address risk of a particular
            security/markets. However when having mixed portfolios it
            becomes difficult to calculate the VaR for the global
            portfolio.

	    This especially because the sub-additivity property is not
            satisfied.

	    #+begin_quote
	    GVAR (Global Vector AutoRegressive) methodology provides a
	    general, yet practical, global modelling framework for the
	    quantitative analysis of the relative importance of
	    different shocks and channels of transmission mechanisms.
	    #+end_quote

	    The individual country models are linked in a consistent manner
	    so that the GVAR model is solved for the world as a whole.

       5.   What is the one-day VaR of a $50m portfolio with a daily
            standard deviation of 2% at a 95% confidence level?

	    The daily so it is:

	    VaR = 50M * 2* 0.02 = 2 Mio.

	    What is the annualized VaR?

	    Here there is time aggregation. You would need a *Loss
            distribution model* for that time horizon. If you assume
            i.i.d. returns then you can compute the annualized VaR as:

	    #+begin_quote
	    VaR (1-day) + sqrt (365) = VaR (1-year)
	    #+end_quote

*** Extreme Value Theory
   
     1. What do you know about extreme value theory:

	In extreme value theory you try to model the tails of the
        distribution.

	The issue is that for extreme events we have just a few
        observations. Moreover such events there is non-stationarity
        in the series. It is therefore impossible to treat them via
        *times series techniques*.

	The idea is then to abandon times series modeling.

	The idea is to say.. you have realizations with distribution
        F.

	Then you ask what is the relation between the maximum among a
        series X_1, ..., X_n and the tails of the distribution of F?

	Then the idea is to get a sequence of maximum losses M_n as
        defined above, normalize this and check if it converges in
        distribution to some distribution function H (X).

	Then the idea is to create such sequences of maximum losses
        from the data and estimate some extreme value distribution to
        which it converges to. You also have to estimate the
        normalizing factors. You then have an estimate for the
        functional form of the tails (heavy tails).

	Then there techniques to estimate the parameters of such
        extreme value distributions. See for instance Hill-estimator
        and Peak over Threshold.

*** Expected Shortfall
   
     1. What is Expected Shortfall?

	It is the tail loss expectation. I.e. the expectation of
        losses over the VaR loss.

	/If things go bad - how bad can they get?/

     2. Why is it considered better than VaR?

	It addresses the two pitfalls above. I.e. does take into
        account the entire tail. And is not blind from a threshold on
        so to say.

	Moreover it fulfills sub-additivity.

	Moreover it is an *average*. CLT and LLN apply.
	
     3. Disadvantages of ES?

        *Backtesting more difficult*.

	Less data. 
     
*** Incremental Default Risk

    Default risk *incremental to what is calculated through the
    Value-at-risk model*, which often does not adequately capture the
    risk associated with illiquid products.


*** Risk Neutrality and Pricing of Securities

    Here the entire idea is that if you have a set of n-linear
    independent markets payoff for n-state, then you can create a risk
    free security out of it.

    If you have a risk free security you know that its return must be
    the risk-free rate.

    Then you know that you should not be able to earn more than the
    risk-free rate on it.

    Then you can price any security according to such schema.

    Arrow-Debreu price -> payoff 1 in one state 0 in all others.

    Then with Arrow-Debreu prices you can get to the risk-neutral
    expected payoff and price pay-off according to the risk-free rate.
    
** Yield Curve


   - What is the discount factor? How would you calculate it?

     Discount factor is the 1/ (1 + r) factor per period through which
     you convert the future cash flow into Present Value cash flows.

     How do you calculate it?

     From the Bond price. You have an equation with known cash flows
     and known price. Solve for the unkown variable.

     This consists of risk-free rate plus risk-specific risk premium
     of a particular stock.

     You can then subtract the risk free rate from the treasury yield
     curve to obtain the risk premium.
     
   - What is the riskiest part of the yield curve?

     Under normal yield curve - the longer the horizon the riskier the
     estimate is.

     Even short deviations of interest rates have a huge impact on the
     price on the net-present value of zero bond such that you will
     have a huge impact on spot rate determined from these.
     
   - What does it mean for risk when the yield curve is inverted?

     The relation of spot rates r_t to their respective maturities t
     is called the term structure of interest rates.

     Spot Rate=(Face Value/Current Bond Price)^(1/Years To Maturity)−1

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-16_um_14.13.40.png" class="center">
#+end_export

     Inverted yield curve means that future cash flow are less
     discounted than interest rates obtained in the next recent
     period.

     This means that the risk and liquidity premium for cash flows
     obtained in recent period is higher than the one of the future.

     This is seen as a precursor of an economic recession.

     As a practical matter, recessions usually cause interest rates to
     fall.

   - What is duration?

     The duration as a relative risk measure characterizes the
     relative change of the bond price due to an absolute *parallel
     shift* in the spot curve.

     First derivative of bond price with respect to interest rate.

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-16_um_14.42.32.png" class="center">
#+end_export

     In the case of non-flat term structure. I.e. when you work with
     the spot rate:

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-16_um_14.43.52.png" class="center">
#+end_export
   

   The duration of a bond portfolio is the *weighted sum of durations
   of its components* (duration is linear).

   - What is convexity? How would you calculate it? Why is it
     important?

     Second derivative of bond price w.r.t. interest rate.

     As the bond price does not react linearly to interest rates
     movements but in a convex way you correct for such convex
     structure with convexity.

     Duration + Convexity  = Taylor expansion of second order.

   - Relation between coupon rate and convexity.

     The higher the coupon rate the lower convexity.

   - What's the meaning of partial duration?

      I think this is key-rate duration.

** Quantitative Concepts

   - assumptions behind Black Scholes?

     1. stock follows a GBM with *constant* drift and volatility.

     2. short selling is allowed

     3. no market frictions - transaction costs, taxes, securities are
        arbitrarily divisible etc.

     4. No dividends

     5. No arbitrage opportunities exist

     6. Securities are traded continously

     7. Risk free constant for all maturities


   - what are Greeks?

     greeks are the partial derivative of the derivative price with
     respect to the model parameters movements.

     1. Monte Carlo Methods

	Estimate the price of derivatives by simulating underlying
        price movements. Computing payoffs and discounting these
        according to risk-free payoff.

     2. Finite Difference Methods:

	Numerical method for discretizing the fundamental PDE.

     3. Analytical Methods:

	For some derivative exists.

    - What do you know about jump processes?

     These are stochastic processes that make different assumptions on
      the underlying price movements in comparison to the standard GBM
      process.

     You add jumps parameters in the stochastic differential
     equation. Jumps are modeled by a poisson process. etc.

     
    - Should you use implied or historical volatility for estimating
      future volatility?

      I would generally go with implied volatility. I would however
      first be sure that the market is liquid and there are no supply
      or demand imbalances driven by short term events.

      See for instance the below:

      The level of supply and demand, which drives implied volatility
      metrics, can be affected by a variety of factors ranging from
      market-wide events to news related directly to a single
      company. For example, if several Wall Street analysts make
      forecasts three days before a quarterly earnings report that a
      company will soundly beat expected earnings, implied volatility
      and options premiums could increase substantially in the few
      days preceding the report. Once the earnings are reported,
      implied volatility is likely to decline in the absence of a
      subsequent event to drive demand and volatility.
     
   
** Hedging

   - An option is at the money. How many shares of stock should you
     hold to hedge it?

     Generally speaking, an at-the-money option usually has a delta at
     approximately 0.5 or -0.5. Measures the impact of a change in
     volatility.

     This is just a rough approximation as there the option price
     change with respect to the fundamental is particularly convex.


   - What is volatility smile?

     The idea is that volatility is an input variable for the
     BS-formula.

     Implied volatility is the volatility such that the option price
     meets the actual observed market price.

     Volatility smile shows how the implied volatility changes with
     strike price.

     As there is no closed form solution for solving for the implied
     volatility you must use numerical methods to invert such
     function.

   - when does hedging increase the risk?

     PREFERRED answer:

     If you just delta hedge you might end up with higher risk related
     to the other *greek letters*.

     Moreover note that delta hedging implies a buy high sell low
     trading rule.

     Moreover because of many model assumptions such as instantaneous
     movements, local measures and model risk your hedge might in
     general increase the risk.

     OUTDATED:
   
     Hedging can increase your risk if you are forced to both buy
     short-dated options and hedge them.

     idea then your option might exipire and you cannot sell or
     realize profit as the price did not change too much to go out of
     money.

   - How would you hedge against a particular equity/bond under
     current market conditions?

     You can delta hedge the risk.

** Products
   
    - What is interest rate risk? What is reinvestment risk?

      For investors an increase in *interest rates* has *two effects*.

      1. Prices of existing bonds drop in value (*interest rate risk*,
         *price risk*)

      2. received coupons can be invested at higher
         rates. (*reinvestment risk*)

      If investment horizon matches the duration both effects *offset
      each other*.

    - Which bond has the greatest associated interest rate risk? A
      five year zero coupon bond? Or a five year bond that pays
      coupons?

      a zero coupon bond. there all of the cash flow concentrated in
      long-horizon so that given movements in interest rates more
      affected due to higher discounting.

    - Which is more volatile, a 20-year zero coupon bond or a 20-year
      4.5% coupon bond?

      Answer 20-year zero coupon.

    - You have two options with the same underlying strike price. One
      has an exercise date in three months, one has an exercise date
      in six months. Which comes with the greatest risk?

      The one six months. More uncertainty about the end-resulting
      price. More volatility.


    - What’s the maximum potential loss you could incur by selling a
      put on a stock?

      The strike price -  price of selling option (that was your
      payoff).

    - What are the risks inherent in an interest rate swap?

    - A stock is selling at $90. A 3-month call with a strike price of
      $100 is selling for $3.105 with a delta of 0.329. How many call
      contracts are required to perform a hedge on 1,000 shares of
      this stock? Would they be bought or sold? What happens if the
      price of the stock falls to $50?

      Delta hedge = 1000 * 0.329

      It is call option. In order to hedge it means I have to have the
      opposite payoff. So if market goes up I have to have negative
      payoff. It means you have to sell.

      What happens if the price of the stock falls to $50?

      You are once more not fully hedged. This because there is
      convexity and the price movement was too big.
    
*** TODO

    - What are the risks inherent in an interest rate swap?

      It depends in which position are you. If you are selling the
      fixed component in exchange for the variable one you suffer from
      declining interest rates and vice versa.

    - How would you decide which discount curve to use to value future
      cash flows from interest rate swaps?

      Two valuations possibilities.

      1. swap as a difference between two bonds

      2. as a set of forward rate agreements.


      Regarding 1. V_swap = B_fl - B_fix. At the next accrual period
      the B_fl will be valued at it's principal amount. So just
      compute the difference until accrual.


** Regulation

   - Which extreme events should stress tests be taking into
     consideration now?

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-16_um_16.56.16.png" class="center">
#+end_export


   Given such variables I would say:

   1. Interest rates (see effect of starting doubts on rising
      inflation and effect on prices)

   2. Equity markets - especially tech markets. Some people claim
      these are vastly overvalued. 

   3. GDP and Unemployment - due to covid

   4. Plus debt markets - very special situation due to Covid. Lots of
      liquidity in the market. Huge debt of Governments.

   - Why is Basel II blamed for precipitating the 2008 financial
     crisis?

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-05-16_um_19.32.06.png" class="center">
#+end_export


   The 2008 financial crisis revealed a major gap in the inability to
   adequately identify the credit risk of the trading book positions
   
   - How has Babel III changed the treatment of market risk?

     There was the introduction of liquidity ratios and another
     liquidity factor..

     Introduced internationally consistent liquidity standards, a
     leverage constraint, and a floor requirement applied to
     risk‐weighted assets (RWAs).

     To limit *procyclicality* macro-prudential regulation.
     
   - What the implications of Basel IIIs new trading book rules for
     market risk professionals?

     they will likely have to price in the higher cost of capital for
     increased book.. don't know exactly the answer.. would need to
     collect some more practical experience on the field to answer
     such questions.

   - How could the Basel III treatment of trading books be improved?
     
     don't have enough domain knowledge in that.

   - How will trading businesses change as a result of Basel III
     capital rules for banks’ trading books?

     not have enough domain knowledge in this.

   - Changes in Basel III

     Banks no longer have the option to use the advanced IRB approach
     for certain asset classes. The advanced IRB approach allows banks
     to estimate PD and EAD in certain scenarios, particularly when
     there are insufficient data to model an exposure in precise
     terms. Instead, they are now required to use the Foundation IRB
     approach which introduces fixed values for the LGD and EAD.


   - A lot of talking about this fundamental review of trading book

* What are your key strengths

  - say extensive exposure to stochastic simulation. especially
    MCMC-Monte carlo methods, importance sampling, rejection sampling
    etc.

  - like also non-linear times series models. at the time of my thesis
    I explored GTS trees. but also threshold VAR models. also read
    some literature with MC-regimes switching VAR - of Guidolin and
    others. Would love to expand on these.

  - could refine my programming knowledge in the last 2 years and
    collect best practices in programming and software development
    which will surely be useful in the long run, for developing
    quality software.
