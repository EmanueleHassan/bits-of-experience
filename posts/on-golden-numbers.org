So it is slowly becoming clear that golden numbers are the core.

Geometry is important and you should understand better these.

They carry most of the information that is around in the world. They
are very powerful numbers.

Understand them, understand well the golden mean spiral, fibonacci and
binary and you will have a profound understanding of the things.

** On Phi and Fibonacci

   This one is very core. It is everywhere in architecture and
   nature. 

   People recognize it at subconscious level. Some might even make the
   thing explicit. But you should be careful with it. Many bad things
   in history happened because of this.


** On Pi

   Pi is the constant used to calculate the circumfernece and the area
   of circle.

   Circle that important geometrical shape, which properties we can
   but approximate through this beautiful irrational number.

   Isn't life funny?

   One of the core geometrical shapes and we can but approximate. So
   fascinating this world. 

   Well it turns out that a lot of people wrap their head around this
   question. 

   The question of it is how many times does a square represented by
   the radius of the circle fit within the circle.

   One way to compute the area of the circle and therefore
   approximating this constant was from Archimedes. He basically used
   the bisection method. 

   He created polygonos around the circle which area he could
   compute with standard results. He then created polygonos within the
   circle. He could again compute the area with standard tools. He
   could then infer the boundaries of the pi constant. 

   Think about the Metraton cube in this sense. There all of the
   polygonos are potentially embedded in a sphere/circle. Is there any
   link among the two?

   The question is now: how is Pi nowadays computed? How many numbers
   did they estimate? Is the approach similar to the one of Archimedes?


** On e

   So this is a number that represents the following limit.

   It is easy to see in this sense why it is so widely used in
   finance and especially in the limit case of continuous time.
