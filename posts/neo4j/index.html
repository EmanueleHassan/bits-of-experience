graph structures and I deeply believe in them so I am very happy to

<h2 id="org191b659">On the benefit of Graph Structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org191b659">
<p>
This section makes clear why for some structures it makes sense to
use graph databases instead of going with relational databases.
</p>

<p>
Consider for instance a friendship database. This has the following
shape:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_10.17.51.png" class="center"><p>
As you can see above in the <code>T_USER</code> table you assign a primary key
to each person. Then on the <code>T_USER_FRIEND</code> table you have a primary
key <code>id</code> representing the friendship relation id and a friendship
relation represented by two foreign keys referencing the <code>T_USER</code>
primary key.
</p>

<p>
It follows immediately that if you want to get the number of friends
of a single person this can be easily done by:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="k">select</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">distinct</span> <span class="n">uf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">t_user_friend</span> <span class="n">uf</span> <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">uf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">user_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">?</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
What about finding the number of friends of a all of my friends?
</p>

<p>
Then you would need to do a join operation in a relational database
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="k">select</span> <span class="k">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">distinct</span> <span class="n">uf2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">t_user_friend</span> <span class="n">uf1</span>
    <span class="k">inner</span> <span class="k">join</span> <span class="n">t_user_friend</span> <span class="n">uf2</span> <span class="k">on</span> <span class="n">uf1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">user_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">uf2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">user_2</span>
    <span class="k">where</span> <span class="n">uf1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">user_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">?</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
I.e. you would first select all of my friends friends by doing the
join operation. And then simply count the number of distinct
entries.
</p>

<p>
You understand now that if you want to find the friends of the
friends of my friends you would do 3 join operations etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that, although you’re only interested in friends of friends of
a single user, you have to perform a <b>join of all data</b> in the
t<sub>user</sub><sub>friend</sub> table, and then discard all rows that you’re not
interested in.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that as each join computes a cartesian product down
the hood such operations become quickly extremely computational
intense. Even with smaller databases the size of the joins increase
exponentially in the depth of the friendships relations.
</p>

<p>
It is so straightforward to see that in such cases relational
databases are not the best way of representing the data for making
such queries.
</p>

<p>
Graph databases were developed to deal exactly with such type of
queries and data models. Here the idea is to use graph theory to
answer such queries in a more efficient way using the concept of
<i>traversal</i>, i.e. by <i>visiting nodes in the graph by moving between
nodes connected with relationships</i>.
</p>

<p>
The key concept of traversals is that they’re <b>localized—querying</b>
the data using a traversal only takes into account the data that’s
required, without needing to perform expensive grouping operations
on the entire data set, like you do with join operations on
relational data.
</p>

<p>
Note moreover that as long as you perform queries that leverage some
graph distance concept - such as the friends of friends - the
performance of queries is optimized and scale well with the size of
the database. I.e. while making a query at depth 5 (i.e. friends of
friends of friends etc.) on a table with million entries will
quickly break down your hardware resources - due to the <b>global
structure of the query</b> - a graph database will continue to perform
the local operations from the node of interest visiting by
traversal. I.e. it will continue to do <b>local-queries</b> that will not
be much affected of the overall size of the database and can
therefore quickly scale.
</p>

<h2 id="org3b7c0ca">Label-property based vs. RDF graphs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b7c0ca">
<p>
These are very different and this should be your first call when
working with graph databases.
</p>

<p>
Essentially if you primarily need to walk, query and analyse paths
through your graph, then Labelled-Property graphs are probably the
way to go. If you are more interested in the nature of the
relationships between things, and creating rich semantic
representations of things, then RDF graphs hit the spot. (<a href="https://datalanguage.com/blog/graphql-and-graph-databases">source</a>)
</p>

<p>
This should give you some more intuition into the topic

So go over it at some point and understand the difference in depth
and do some longer post. <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/rdf-triple-store-vs-labeled-property-graph-difference/">This</a> is a good reference in this sense.

<div id="outline-container-org2cd2b57" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2cd2b57">Data Modeling in Neo4j</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cd2b57">
<p>
Interestingly Neo4j is <i>schemaless</i>, so unlike classical databases
you do not have to specify the schema and relationships before
starting to write the data into it.
</p>

<p>
This means that the data model for a Neo4j database is <i>implicit</i> in
the data it contains, <i>rather than explicitly</i> defined as part of the
database itself. In this sense the data model is a <b>description</b> of
the data it contains rather than being a <b>prescription</b> of what it
should contain. So that we can say overall that the data model is
<b>descriptive</b>.
</p>

<p>
In this sense the query language works in <i>pattern defined way</i>
instead of a rigid relation based way as the one you are used to
work in RDMS. The Neo4j query language, <b>Cypher</b>, works by <i>matching
patterns</i> in the data, so one way to see your data model is as an
inventory of basic patterns.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, to structure your queries in a meaningful way what
you usually do is to draw diagrams for portion of the
graph. Understand the common patterns and reason about meaningful
queries to do according to that.
</p>

<p>
Note that in Neo4j the first class citizens as in any graph are
nodes and edges. However, despite of this, not everything must be
modeled as a node or an edge. <b>Nodes and Edges</b> can have
<b>properties</b>. These are attributes of the node that can be accessed
with the standard <code>node.property</code> syntax. Properties are saved as
<code>key-value</code> pairs.  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org134fa47" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org134fa47">Domain Modeling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org134fa47">
<p>
This has important consequences for the domain modeling - consider
the following example:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-17_um_16.39.08.png" class="center"><p>
Then you should be careful when checking if the above is the most
meaningful model. It might well be that some of these nodes might be
well be modeled as properties. Hence in general when you have
<code>has_property</code> relations consider well if what you need is indeed a
node or whether you can model via properties.
</p>

<p>
In fact unless, for some reason, you wanted to link users together
based on their favorite colors, there’s probably no need for
<i>FavoriteColor</i> to be modeled as a node; it could be an property on
the <i>User</i> node.
</p>

<p>
Hence leveraging the property function you would come up with
something as that in the end:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-17_um_16.44.12.png" class="center" style="width: 30% !important;"><p>
Now suppose you want to distinguish between a user’s current and
previous addresses. One way to do this would be to attach an
<code>is_current</code> flag to the address node as an property. But if two
users had lived at the same address, and one was the current and the
other a previous occupant, then whatever value this flag had would
be false for one of them. Being a user’s current address is <b>not a
property of the address itself, or of the user</b>, but of the
<b>relationship</b> between them—a relationship that may change over time,
as users move from one address to another.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-17_um_16.47.46.png" class="center"><p>
Note now that a further way to refine the above is to set the
<code>is_current</code> tag as a <b>property</b> of the relation itself.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-17_um_16.53.14.png" class="center"><p>
So in general when modeling with graph databases you should make
yourself clear what you want to model as <b>entities</b> (which will be
nodes), what you want to model as <b>relations</b> (which will be edges)
and finally the properties that the above should have.
</p>

<p>
An important thing to consider when making such choice is as well
to consider the speed at which you can <b>traverse</b> the graph. It is
clear that depending on how you model the entities you will have a
better or worse performance.
</p>

<p>
For instance you should not create new nodes/entities which main
purpose is to store <i>additional</i> properties for some entity. To do
that a new possibility is incorporated into the <code>Neo4j</code> API as of
version 2.0, i.e. the possibility of assigning <b>labels</b> to
nodes. Think of labels as <i>collection IDs</i> through which as
mentioned you can assign nodes to given <b>collections</b>. Note that
single nodes might be assigned to multiple IDs.
</p>

<p>
Note then that on the one hand by using <b>labels</b> properly you can
reduce the overall number of nodes so that you have a more compact
graph that is easier to traverse.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, you can as well build queries based on the
labels. Like this your query in itself does not have to deal with
missing data as you can base based on the labels just the nodes
that have the additional properties you are interested in.
</p>

<p>
Note that matching a label at query time is done in the following
way <code>(u:User)</code>. Here you are actually selecting all of the nodes
with the <code>label: User</code>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="orgff49107">Neo4j in Production</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff49107">
<p>
As the project is starting pretty quickly I will explore the depths
of the query syntax and traversals later. I will now go straight to
this chapter as pretty soon in the project together with the data
model we will have to make this call.
</p>

<p>
There are essentially two ways to deploy Neo4j, one is <code>embedded</code> mode the other
being <code>server</code> mode. We will see how this decision will influence
how you will work with it.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5aeb02e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5aeb02e">Embedded vs. Server Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5aeb02e">
<p>
At the beginning Neo4j was Java centered. Within the <code>embedded
   mode</code> setup, your Java application and new shiny Neo4j database
were happily <i>bundled together</i> as a single deployable entity, and
together they went forth to conquer the brave new world of
interesting graph-based problems.
</p>

<p>
Neo4j, although written in Java, is inherently just a JVM-based
product. This means that, theoretically, any JVM-based language
(provided the appropriate libraries or bindings can be found or
written) can also make use of the Neo4j database. Thus, Neo4j’s
reach naturally began to extend to other JVM-based languages.
</p>

<p>
But it was the need to operate in more network-friendly
architectures and to support other non-JVM clients that were the
primary drivers behind the introduction of the <code>server mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>With <code>server mode</code>, the Neo4j database runs in its own process, with
clients talking to it via its dedicated HTTP-based REST API.</b> So if
you want to go Pythonic go with server mode.
</p>

<p>
Such that in general the ecosystem of <code>Neo4j</code> would look as
follows:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_11.38.14.png" class="center"><p>
Note that as usual, with the inherent network latency introduced in
the server mode, performance is naturally not going to be as good
as accessing the database using native code directly. To add more
flexibility to the server offering, server plugins and unmanaged
extensions. At the moment I do not think that performance is key
plus to get up and running with Java is not a question to this
stage and will skip it for now and stay in my Pythonic world.       
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org740fbfd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org740fbfd">Server Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org740fbfd">
<p>
Unlike embedded mode, running Neo4j in server mode involves having
all the classes and logic to access and process interactions with
the Neo4j database contained within its own dedicated process,
<i>completely separate from any clients wishing to use it</i>.
</p>

<p>
In order to interact with the server process there is a well-defined, yet extensible,
HTTP-based REST API.
</p>

<p>
The general structure of running Neo4j in server mode is the
following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_15.38.56.png" class="center"><p>
Given the basic structure now the standard question of <code>REST</code>
vs. <code>graphQL</code> vs. other architectures come up.
</p>

<p>
Let me briefly make the excursus on this to this stage.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5b914f1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5b914f1">GRAPHQL vs REST</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5b914f1">
<p>
GraphQL has nothing to do with graph databases. It is much more a
new kind of API originally developed by Facebook that is rapidly
expanding.
</p>

<p>
In simple terms:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GraphQL is a REST API alternative with a structured query language
combined with a runtime for query processing and serving data to
GraphQL clients (and it is almost always implemented with JSON in
mind).
</p>

<p>
GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is
instead backed by your existing code and data.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While RESTful API have in fact many benefits, such as the caching
structures, the general architecture etc. they have a drawback
that has led to the development and a general interest on
GraphQL. The major drawback being the fact that sometimes RESTful
API are too rigid. I.e. this is their power but also their
drawback.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes maybe you are not interested in the entire information
you would obtain from the API. Sometimes to get your information
of need you have to do very complex and chatty API call.  Think of
an API where we first have to GET <i>user first and then fetch each
friend individually via GET /user</i>:id/friend/:id endpoint, this
can result in N+1 queries and is a will known performance issue in
API and database queries. This was in fact the behavior you
observed on your last project API.
</p>


<p>
In other words, RESTful API calls are chained on the client before
the final representation can be formed for display. GraphQL can
reduce this by enabling the server to aggregate the data for the
client in a single query. In fact, GraphQL comes handy as it
creates an API that allows for arbitrary requests that are
complaint with the GraphQL runtime and protocol.
</p>

<p>
This has pro and cons as especially in the case of open API great
care have to be taken to ensure GraphQL queries don’t result in
expensive join queries that can bring down server performance or
even DDoS the server.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb2dd418" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb2dd418">Back to Server Neo4j</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb2dd418">
<p>
So back to the Neo4j server. Given that you are interested in
navigating your graph database it might make little sense to use a
RESTful approach as for instance to navigate such graph you would
have to make multiple iterative calls. Think for instance about
this first call:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_16.21.38.png" class="center"><p>
You can then start from there and navigate your database.
</p>

<p>
However, this is very much impractical.
</p>

<p>
In this sense I read online that it is common practice for some
use cases to leverage GraphQL in such cases. This is in fact a
good example of a possible use case for such technology. In fact
there are built-in GraphQL implementations in Neo4j. On the other
hand I also read online that some complain about it saying that if
you stop by leveraging the GraphQL queries then you probably did
not need a graph database in the first place and a document store
might have been enough. Whatever it is. I guess both have their
point and you will not get completely the point of the discussion
until you make yourself your hands dirty.
</p>

<p>
In any case what is good in Neo4j is that luckily they have
implemented a REST API where you can leverage the Cypher query
language such that you can leverage the standard traversal
properties and get to your data of interest quickly without having
to do all of that manual work iterating over different APIs calls
repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
In fact using the Cypher API, you would make <code>POST</code> of the
following form:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_16.41.56.png" class="center">

<div id="outline-container-org5050640" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5050640">On Remote Client Libraries</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5050640">
<p>
Although it is possible for you to directly talk with the 
RESTful Server directly and get your information via raw API as
done above many suggest to use client libraries to talk with
Neo4j. There again much of the complexity of the raw API is
abstracted away such that you can easily communicate in an
intuitive way.
</p>

<p>
What usually happens is that a runtime is added between your
client and the server. In the runtime running on a standard
framework the complexity is masked and you would use the new
library functions and go through it in the following way:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-03-18_um_16.47.40.png" class="center"><p>
This seems to me quite an overhead also because you would then
have to make sure that everything scales well. So try to
understand better the implications of taking such an approach
should this project become very large at some point.
</p>

<p>
You can find a list of different runtime specific drivers

<div id="outline-container-org3ec357b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3ec357b">On server Plug-ins</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3ec357b">
<p>
This is a nice feature of the Server Mode. The idea is that as
mentioned sometimes you might get back too much information via
API calls. Instead of processing the response on the client when
you get it, what you can do is to write <code>server Plug-ins</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Server plug-ins</code> provide a mechanism for offloading some of the
processing-intensive logic to the server rather than having to
perform it all on the client, with multiple requests having to
flow backward and forward to accomplish the same thing. Server
plugins are sometimes compared to stored procedures in the
relational database world.
</p>

<p>
Server plugins have specifically been designed to extend the
existing REST API options returned for a node, relationship, or
the global graph database. Recall that when you make a request for
the detail of a particular node, you get a lot of options back,
including an <b>extensions key</b>. This will specify the server 
extensions specified for your server.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org05a2f8e">
{ ...
  "extensions" : { . . .},
  "property" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/0/properties/{key}",
  "self" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/0",
  "data" : { "name" : "Adam"  }
  ... }
</pre>

<p>
To write a <code>server plug-in</code> you can extend a <code>ServerPlugin</code> class
that should be contained in your driver.  You should then be sure
that the name of your class extending and inheriting from
<code>ServerPlugin</code> is contained in
<code>org.neo4j.server.plugins.ServerPlugin</code>.
</p>

<p>
If that is the case you should then see it in the extensions in
the <code>json</code> received from the REST endpoint. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org6ddab9b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6ddab9b">Unmanaged Extensions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6ddab9b">
<p>
If you require complete control over your server-side code, then
unmanaged extensions may be what you’re looking for. Unlike
<code>server plugins</code>, which merely allow you to <i>augment the existing
REST API</i> at specific points, <code>unmanaged extensions</code> essentially
allow you to <i>define your own domain-specific REST API</i>.
</p>

<p>
This means that instead of dealing with general nodes and
relationships, you can now with a specific set of nodes - say
Users and Movies. This was not an option for <code>server
    Plugins</code>. There you could just specify a plugin at a node level
that would be available across all nodes.
</p>

<p>
Broadly speaking, you define a class, which, through a set of
annotations, binds the class to a particular URL pattern and mount
point within the Neo4j server. When this mount point is invoked,
control is transferred to this class, which can have full access
to the Neo4j graph database, allowing the class to perform
whatever actions or functionality is required, returning the data
in whatever format is desired.

<h2 id="org6bbd322">Neo4j for Ontologies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6bbd322">
<p>
This is a good example of making more value out of Neo4j. At the end
of the presentation he rushed a bit too much so it was not easy for
an intro person like me. What I am still missing is why you need to
go through RDF structures. Probably because the imported Ontology is
defined in that terms. Would definitely need to make more research
in any case.
</p>

<p>
As for inference.. I think that to name inference the thing in the
video is a little bit too much and misleading. Maybe I am missing a
point. 
</p>

<p>
From what I can get the "inference" goes as follows.
</p>

<p>
You have a graph database containing some entities. You import an
ontology that specifies the relation among entities - even inserting
new entities and mapping subcategories etc.
</p>

<p>
You can now search and filter based on the new entities relations
defined in the ontology. So you can "infer" (or let's say read) from
the ontology some new knowledge on the relations.
</p>

<div class="container"> 
  <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wluUfomasg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</div>

<p>
So nice but that can be used in a straightforward for my project. If
there is an ontology for the case at issue it might be very
useful. What you have however to consider is on how to make your
semantics sharable. In fact this is a question you should ask when
creating your data model.
</p>

<p>
Do I want to create an ontology on top of data objects to map the
model domain? Should I do it in RDF form and feed it into the graph
database as described in the video?
</p>

<p>
Should I work just mapping relations among the data objects
themselves without creating a separate ontology on top of it?
</p>

<p>
These are all questions you should address with the domain experts
of your problem.  Consider such things in the introductory talk for
the project.
</p>

<p>
Ok lucky me - there seem to be an ontology available for the use
case. So it is always worthy to check at the material around.

<p>
An IBM group did some project with it and connected the Discovery
services with Neo4j. They implemented a microservices structure with
a Flask backend that is orchestrating the entire thing.
</p>

<p>
The solution with Discovery is ingenious. A bit an overkill in my
opinion and I doubt it will run smoothly without a lot of fine
tuning. For the PoC I will just borrow from that code to connect to
Neo4j and use an Angular app for the visualization.

<div id="outline-container-orgefcdee6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgefcdee6">Neo4j Install on Kuberenetes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgefcdee6">
<p>
So for the project we will work with a kubernetes cluster. So the
next steps will be to install the Neo4j Community Edition on our
cluster.
</p>

<p>
While it is out of the box and straightforward to install Neo4j
Enterprise Edition on it the community edition process seems to be
more convoluted.
</p>

<p>
Let's try to see by trial and error how long it will take to me.
</p>

<p>
I also question if it makes sense to work with a helm chart
directly as I will not be able to scale in either case with the
community edition and you will generally probably not be able to use
the benefit of kubernetes. Anyways let's leave the point open and
let's try to install it. If it is quick it's fine. Then you are
already on the platform so that post-PoC you will be able to
quickly expand. Moreover like this you will be able to expand and
refresh your skills on k8s. 
</p>

<p>
So apparently it is possible to use the enterprise edition neo4j
helm chart and change some parameters. Check <a href="https://community.neo4j.com/t/neo4j-community-edition-on-kubernetes/4955/4">this link</a> in this
sense.
</p>

<p>
Note that the above is fine in the general sense i.e. some of these
parameters I guess still hold and probably you can change the
structure and achieve the same as mentioned there. The helm chart
mentioned there is outdated in any case.
</p>

<p>
The new chart is <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm/">this</a>.
</p>

<p>
So try to install it:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  helm install neo-helm https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm/releases/download/4.2.2-1/neo4j-4.2.2-1.tgz --set core.standalone<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span> --set <span class="nv">acceptLicenseAgreement</span><span class="o">=</span>yes --set <span class="nv">neo4jPassword</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"MYPASSWORD"</span> --namespace usz-sarcoma
</pre></div>

<p>
Good, now you have <code>services</code> and <code>persitant volume</code> associated with
it. Note that I installed the core.standalone mode where
Replicasets are ignored and it acts as the community
edition. I.e. it does not scale etc. Try to understand if with this
you are fine or not.
</p>

<p>
Ok so after installation I can see the various services running
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  kubectl get services --namespace usz-sarcoma
</pre></div>
<p>

</p>

<p>
And you will have your persitant storage associated with the service
as well
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  kubectl get pvc
</pre></div>
<p>
NAME                            STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE

</p>

<p>
Good. Now you can also see your running pod that is running the
services
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  kubectl get pods

neo-helm-neo4j-core-0   1/1     Running   0          3h42m
</p>

<p>
Well done. You must now expose the services to the outside world. I
will start easily by testing it locally doing a port forward.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  kctl port-forward neo-helm-neo4j-core-0 <span class="m">7474</span>:7474 <span class="m">7687</span>:7687 <span class="m">7473</span>:7473 --namespace usz-sarcoma
</pre></div>

<p>
Good. You can now access the neo4j webapp at <code>localhost:7474</code> and
access the database from there via <code>localhost:7687</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can start playing with it. Understand the visualization and the
application schema through which you will communicate with the
database. Then come back to expose the service to the outside world.

Neo4j’s graphs are directed, which means that each relationship must

direction.

Note that even in the case of a directed relationship you might be
able to infer relationships at query time in any of the two
directions. I.e. you can go against the current so to say and infer

to each other you will ultimately use both of the filters so that

<p>
Interesting. For some reason if you do not set a tag to the Person
<code>nodes</code> above, the database does not recognize these properly and
does not set the attribute of them in the correct way.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so the explanation of the above comes directly in the next
section. The idea is simply that you have plain <code>nodes</code> and
<code>relations</code> if you do not specify any <code>TAGS</code> for them.
</p>

<p>
These are two different exercises. with the <code>:mytag</code> part you
specify labels to the nodes, relations so that you can then
filter based on them at query time. This was briefly touched
upon above in the introduction.

This is important - recall the importance of specifying <code>labels</code>

<p>
It is of paramount importance to have such labels in your
graph. This will allow you to make sense of the entire structure
of your network as well to filter out just <code>nodes</code>, <code>relations</code>
belonging to a specific label category.
</p>

<p>
For instance to get all of the names of the people in your

If you want to specify the relation direction you can use an
ASCII style arrow.
</p>

<p>
Always test in your Neo4j local console this will allow you to
make sense of all of that before going into production.

<p>
Good so that is pretty much very straightforward syntax.

Ok this gave you a basis now. All of the rest I will keep as a
<code>stack-overflow</code> job. With that you should be good to go to make
sense of the logic for the coming weeks.
</p>

<p>
One example could be for instance queries on multiple labels via
an or syntax <code>(node1)-[:label1|label2]-(node2)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover other options consists in:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>specify maximum number of hops distance in the graph  (can be
used in conjunction to the multiple labels case above)</li>

<li>can use properties filter for relationship queries matches</li>

<li>finding shortest path; there is a command exactly for doing
that</li>

<li>Optional matches - If a relationship is optional, use the
<code>OPTIONAL MATCH</code> clause. This is similar to how a SQL outer join
works. If the relationship is there, it is returned. If it’s
not, <code>null</code> is returned in its place.</li>

<li>
<code>WITH</code>; with this you can organize the output and decide on
it.</li>

<li>
<code>FOREACH</code>, apply any of the <code>SET</code>, <code>REMOVE</code>, <code>CREATE</code>, <code>MERGE</code>,
<code>DELETE</code> operations. you apply it to a set of matched results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Generally look check at the <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/">official documentation</a> when you need
to make sense and build up your queries.

<h2 id="org1de0f80">Python Driver</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1de0f80">
<p>
This is mostly straightforward. There is an important difference
between <code>transactions</code> and <code>session</code> that you should get.
</p>

<p>
Check at it here as the answer of a stack overflow post:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Session.run() will actually create a transaction, execute the
statement, and commit the transaction. Transaction.run() will leave
the transaction open until you commit it, but the statement will still
be sent and interpreted and executed, and results will be
returned. However, any changes won't actually be persisted into the
datastore, and won't be visible to queries outside of the
transaction. You have to mark the transaction as successful and commit
it or it will be rolled back.
</p>

<p>
You should try not to use transactions; open transactions prevent
changes to indexes and constraints and increase memory usage. The only
reason to use transactions is for the rollback potential; if you want
to see what the results of the query are, and maybe undo it depending
on those results, then use a transaction. Otherwise use a session.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Important</b> to understand for the python driver is that when you
return nodes these are of a particular class <code>neo4j.graph.Node</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can then check here such a data type and how you work with it
<a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html#graph-data-types">https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html#graph-data-types</a>
</p>

<p>
The basic functioning I saw in some apps built with the driver is to
use a serializer function.
</p>

<p>
This could for instance look as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">serialize_node</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="s1">'title'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'title'</span><span class="p">],</span>
	<span class="s1">'layer'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'layer'</span><span class="p">],</span>
	<span class="s1">'message'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'message'</span><span class="p">],</span>
	<span class="s1">'selected'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'selected'</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then pass this function on a <code>neo4j.graph.Node</code> and save
them in a json affine way.
</p>

<p>
From there it will be usual work.
</p>

<p>
Finally, notice that to get the id, this from <code>__init__</code> in the
python class so that you will work with it by calling it via
<code>node.id</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that if you return entire <code>paths</code> you will need a different
processing.

This is the way you would deal with RDF schema and there are scripts
that parse such into neo4j syntax as import and exports.
</p>

<p>
There are also scripts that deal with ontologies imports. Have to
test these out.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org96ad6d9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org96ad6d9">Install</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org96ad6d9">
<p>
In order to have such toolkit you need to install the extension to
your neo4j database.
</p>

<p>
I will try to do this next in my database running in the oc cluster.
</p>

<p>
First of all ssh into your cluster such that you can have a bash
session over there.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   $ kubectl <span class="nb">exec</span> -ti <span class="nv">$POD_NAME</span> bash
</pre></div>


<p>
Then change your directory to the <code>$NEO4J_HOME</code> directory.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$NEO4J_HOME</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then go to the <code>plugin</code> repo in there
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nb">cd</span> plugins
</pre></div>

<p>
Then you can get the release you want from <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics/releases">here</a> and copy the link of
the jar file of interest.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="c1"># in my case</span>
   $ wget https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics/releases/download/4.2.0.0/neosemantics-4.2.0.0.jar
</pre></div>

<p>
Then I made the following change:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   $ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=n10s.endpoint=/rdf"</span> &gt;&gt; &lt;NEO_HOME&gt;/conf/neo4j.conf
</pre></div>

<p>
Then you should restart the server. I think this is where it is not
working correctly. Cause when I did <code>$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart</code>
it said that there was no instance of neo4j running. 
</p>

<p>
Then it started one. But then I could not find a working mounted
extension as when calling the endpoint I got a 404 error
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   :GET http://localhost:7474/rdf/ping
</pre></div>

<p>
this from the web-browser with port forward. That is weird. Even if
it is pod as long as you do not kill and restart that pod it should
work as a normal neo4j instance. So theoretically the above should
have worked.
</p>

<p>
I will now work with the Desktop version as time is limited. I will
then figure out what is not working in the above. And possibly use a
docker image.

<p>
Basically you have options to specify how URI objects are
translated into your label-property graph.
</p>

<p>
There are default settings on how you treat general structures; you
can check at them by calling <code>n10s.graphconfig.init()</code>.
</p>

<p>
After an initial Graph Config has been created and before the data
is imported, the method <code>n10s.graphconfig.set</code> will let you update
individual configuration items. Here’s an example:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nx">call</span> <span class="nx">n10s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">graphconfig</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">init</span><span class="p">();</span>

   <span class="nx">call</span> <span class="nx">n10s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">graphconfig</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">keepLangTag</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">handleRDFTypes</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"LABELS_AND_NODES"</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Once you specify this general configuration option you can start
importing your RDF data. This can be done via the
<code>n10s.rdf.import.fetch</code> function. From there you can specify a
<code>URL</code> or a local resource to import.
</p>

<p>
For instance, consider the following turtle file.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="err">@</span><span class="nx">prefix</span> <span class="nx">neo4voc</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">http</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="c1">//neo4j.org/vocab/sw#&gt; .</span>

<p>
ok - so pretty straightforward. after calling such function you
will find the converted RDF in your neo4j database.
</p>

<p>
There are a few conversion default you need to understand. Consider
the RDF above. This is converted along the following lines. 
</p>

<img src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2021-04-06_um_10.16.27.png" class="center"><p>
What you can see from the above - and your take away should be the
following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>dataType</code> properties, i.e. relating individuals to literal data
(strings, numbers, datetime etc.), in your RDF have been
converted into node properties</li>

<li>
<code>object properties</code>, i.e. relate individuals to other
individuals, are now relationships connecting nodes.</li>

<li>Every node represents a resource and has a property with its
<code>URI</code>.</li>

<li>
<code>rdf:type</code> statements are transformed into node
labels. I.e. recall that you can think of labels as classID
through which you can filter and sort out your data at query
time.</li>

<li>The URIs identifying the elments in the RDF data (resources,
properties, etc) have their <b>namespace part shortened</b> to make
them more human readable and easier to query with Cypher. See for
instance above how <code>http://neo4j.org/vocab/sw#name</code> turns into
<code>ns0__name</code>. Prefixes for custom namespaces are assigned
dynamically in sequence (<code>ns0</code>, <code>ns1</code>, etc) as they appear in the
imported RDF. There are also options that you can specify in your
general configuration to specify how you should deal with such
prefixes. Check more <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/nsmntx/current/import/">this</a> if interested.</li>
</ul>

The rdf:type statements in RDF (triples) are transformed into

reasonable approach it may not be your preferred option, especially
if you want to load an ontology too and link it to your instance
