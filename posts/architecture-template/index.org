So this is a brief post containing my template for working on IT
systems design.

I use it when working on projects as a way to keep the system under
control through time and to have a general overview of them.

On the top it is good to align the general stakeholders involved in
the system on the general status and direction for the system.

You can find my template schema [[https://github.com/MarcoHassan/architecture_template][here]].

Please note that this nothing but a latex/org mode implementation of
the existing [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjwmcOxg7X6AhWYhv0HHbi2BYcQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoit.maryland.gov%2FSDLC%2FDocuments%2Fsys_design_doc.doc&usg=AOvVaw0PzX5nO87DV9GVSbFrBHOE][maryland governmental template]].
