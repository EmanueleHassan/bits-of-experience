So this tries to summarize a bit the concepts around RiskMetrics.

This is the industry standard in order to compute the risk numbers
etc.

Note that the notes are based on [[https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mappings-motivation/][the following publication]]. Lots of
the statistical concepts are just a mere high level refresher. You
even checked at more sophisticated methods during your studies - see
for instance the GARCH and multivariate GARCH models.

So lots of the material is skipped in these notes. Just saving the
interesting parts of it that do not add to the rest. Interesting was
especially the brief section [[*From ALM to VaR][From ALM to VaR]]. This is a thing that I
definitely have to understand better and the current location of the
industry and of the company in this dimension.

Important is as well to better understand that transition from
accounting values to market values. This is an entire very important
space that I have no clue about. Not so in line with my interests
cause I never liked too much accounting as a subject, but if you do
not understand that piece of the cake you might as well not loose time
in understanding all of the rest as everything starts from there.

{{{TEASER_END}}}


** Basics

   RiskMetrics has three basic components:

  - A set of market risk measurement methodologies outlined in this
    document.

  - Data sets of volatility and correlation data used in the
    computation of market risk.

  - Software systems developed by J.P.Morgan, subsidiaries of Reuters,
    and third party vendors  that implement the methodologies described herein.   

  So you see the source of your confusion. The modeling part is just
  but one of the components of the RiskMetrics system. The other two
  components are part of it and that is the difference between the
  pure VaR component and this one.


*** History

    Interesting is to read about the [[https://www.value-at-risk.net/riskmetrics/][RiskMetrics history]] as well and
    how it came to be. Now you are in the industry. 40 years ahead more
    less. Sky is the limit - always - cause you point to 100 and you
    will get 30 if you know what I mean :). 

    So basically as mentioned a couple of time we go with the RiskMetrics
    JP Morgan model that the entire industry is using. When you have time
    it will be worth to start digging into [[https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5915b101-4206-4ba0-aee2-3449d5c7e95a][this one as well]] - this will
    give you a more solid understanding of it and you will be able to
    start drawing bechmarks to what you have in place here.


*** On the data distributed

    Daily recomputed data sets which are comprehensive sets of
    consistently estimated instrument level VaRs (i.e., 1.65 standard
    deviations) and correlations across a large number of asset
    classes and instruments.

    We currently distribute three different data sets over the
    Internet: one for short term trading risks, the second for
    intermediate term investment risks and the third for regulatory
    reporting. These are made available to the market free of charge.

    
*** Workflow

    The workflow in RiskMetrics is essentially the following:

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 085036.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    So this is maybe performed by the external provider we use when
    getting the relevant simulations.    


** From ALM to VaR

   There is already this interesting chapter over here. Cause you have
   to understand if this is a little bit the idea of the ALM in your
   team or if it has nothing to do with it.

   I think it does, at least partially. Probably and most likely not
   completely. So cool, you also covered a little bit more of
   understanding in this sense. You understand now what it is going
   on.

   The idea is that just for some items you can actually *mark to
   market* and do all of your relevant calculations from there.

   But in general:

   #+begin_quote
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
   #+end_quote


*** Basically you have ALM and Market Risk

    - For ALM the workflow is essentially the following:

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 094942.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    - For Market risk the workflow is essentially the following:
      
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 095052.png" class="center">
    #+end_export


*** On the complications that this brings along

    Check at the following:

    #+begin_quote
The distinction between accrual items and trading items and their
separate treatment for market risk management has led to significant
complications—particularly when transactions classified as “trading
items” under generally accepted accounting principles are used to
hedge transactions classified as “accrual items”.

In an effort to overcome this difficulty, many firms – particularly
those with relatively large trading books have expanded the market
risk approach to also include accrual items, at least for internal
risk management reporting. This is done by estimating the fair market
value of the accrual items and the changes in their fair value under
different short term scenarios. Thus we are witnessing the evolution
of an alternative to the conventional approach of Asset/Liability
Management, the Value-at-Risk approach. It started in pure trading
operations, but is now gaining increased following in the financial
industry.
    #+end_quote

    Ok so you see... I  think that the latter is what is going on in
    our team.

    So have to understand if there is still part of the conventional
    ALM model or if everything was converted into the VaR approach.

    I guess so. Maybe ask Massimo. Anyways check at the general
    overview next.
    

*** Steps in the framework fo modern financial management

    Basically the thing looks as follows:
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-03 103720.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    So you see that the thing below is exactly what it is happening in
    our team.

    So you see that it is always important to read into the general
    literature that you find online. It will give you this high level
    understanding of what is going on that your team is not managing
    to provide you.

    On /the valuation compoenent/:

    #+begin_quote
    To value transactions for which, in the absence of a liquid
    secondary market, no market value exists, we first map them into
    equivalent positions, or decompose them into parts for which
    secondary market prices exist. The most basic such “part” is a
    single cash flow with a given maturity and currency of the
    payor. Most transactions can be described as a combination of such
    cash flows and thus can be valued approximately as the sum of
    market values of their component cash flows.


    Only non-marketable items that contain options cannot be valued in
    this simple manner. For their valuation we also need expected
    volatilities and correlations of the prices and rates that affect
    their value, and we need an options pricing model. Volatilities
    describe potential movements in rates with a given probability;
    correlations describe the interdependencies between different
    rates and prices. Thus, for some valuations, we require
    volatilities and correlations.
    #+end_quote 
    
    
** Different types of Simulation

   Again, there are different types of ways to parametrize the VaR.

   
*** RiskMetrics

    RiskMetrics uses historical time series analysis to derive
    estimates of volatilities and correlations on a large set of
    financial instruments.

    It assumes that the distribution of past returns can be modelled
    to provide us with a reasonable forecast of future returns over
    different horizons.
   

*** Historical Simulation Approach

    On the official documentation it is written that:

    #+begin_quote
    The historical simulation approach, which is usually applied under a
    full valuation model, makes no explicit assumptions about the
    distribution of asset returns.

    Under historical simulation, portfolios are valued under a number of
    different historical time windows which are user defined.

    These lookback periods typically range from 6 months to 2 years.
    #+end_quote

    How these scenarios are generated varies across models, from basic
    historical simulation to distributions of returns generated from a
    set of volatility and correlation estimates such as RiskMetrics.
    
    
*** Monte Carlo Simulation

    This is the concept you know well. Use it when you cannot
    establish a clear distribution for your return in order to compute
    your VaR measure.

    This is usally done in combination to the historical simulation
    approach described above that would ultimately yield you the
    desired unknown distribution.

    
*** Implied Volatilities

    You can check at them to get a forward looking volatility estimate
    based on the market price of the derivatives on a given
    instrument.

    In such a way you do not have to rely on the historical values for
    the vola. The issue is that it is not always possible to get to
    the relevant implicit volatilities as there are not always
    derivatives for every underlying of interest.


*** User Defined Curves

    This is the way to add the relevant scenarios (in the insurance
    space) or stress tests (in the banking space) in order to make the
    relevant topside adjustments to your model based risk numbers.
    

** Determining the way you express your risk

   This is as well another important mental game that is important to
   play.

   Just in such a way you can set the things into perspective and you
   can manage to understand the right kind of questions without taking
   everything at face value.

   Understand the following:

   #+begin_quote
Position limits have traditionally been expressed in nominal terms,
futures equivalents or other denominators unrelated to the amount of
risk effectively incurred.

[Say for instance the manager of a USD bond portfolio was told:]

100 million limit is in 2-year equivalents.

Now, setting limits in terms of Value-at-Risk has significant advantages:
position benchmarks become a function of risk and positions in
different markets while products can be *compared through this common
measure*. A common denominator rids the standard limits manuals of a
multitude of measures which are different for every asset class.
   #+end_quote

   Note that it is mentioned in the Riskmetrics paper the following:
   
   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-13 184208.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   I do not agree very much with this statement. This is why you
   actually learn in academia that ES is a superior risk metrics. It
   is good in this sense how we operate.

   
** On the performance evaluation triangle

   Again another interesting input. Check the following:

   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-13 185139.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   You see that with proper risk numbers you can estimate and render
   more valuable statistics that can be used in order to track the
   performance of the traders.

   Would be interesting in this sense to understand what the manager
   selection team does in this dimension. Which metrics are used? Who
   produces them? Go and talk with the person you know.
