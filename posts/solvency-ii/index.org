So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.

This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.

On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.

Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.

     idea about the different viewpoints based on the market. Will
     help you a bit to understand both solvency II as well as
     understanding better the general space you are moving in.


** Technical Provisions

   Technical provisions represent the amount that the insurance company
   would have to pay in order to transfer its obligations immediately
   to another insurance company.

   Solvency II requires that technical provisions be calculated as the
   sum of the best estimate of the liability and a risk margin to cover
   the cost of the capital another insurer would need to hold to take on
   the liability.

   So you see the first bridge. The concept of risk margin is the
   pillar of both methodologies, when transferring claims to other
   insurances in case of stress.
