<p>
So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.
</p>

<p>
This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://www.actuary.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Solvency-II-Risk-Margin-FINAL-1.pdf">A review of the design of solvency II risk margin</a>.</li>

<p>
Note as well the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/927345/Solvency_II_Call_for_Evidence.pdf">UK review of it</a>. Interesting to see and get an
idea about the different viewpoints based on the market. Will
help you a bit to understand both solvency II as well as
understanding better the general space you are moving in.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update 19/04:</i> Note that this is as well interesting. During the
last weekend started a query on google news about solvency II.
</p>

<p>
There is a big discussion about it and a possible reform that is
coming. They were as well citing that UK review as a thing worth
of consideration. So you see how everything is interrelated. Like
in software ultimately. Everyone coping each other but in the end
interrelation is big.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Other possible <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fgpp.2008.43.pdf">good read</a> - there are as well sources
there.
</p>

<p>
That is in fact true. From it you basically immediately find the
following source, which is the important one. Not academic but
rather targeted to EU commission. Thorough reading. With it you
should ultimately understand the thing.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://www.knf.gov.pl/knf/pl/komponenty/img/Assessment_of_the_overall_financial_position_of_an_insuranc_18428.pdf">KPMG on behalf of EU Commission - study into methodologies to

<div id="outline-container-org5f62753" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5f62753">Technical Provisions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5f62753">
<p>
Technical provisions represent the amount that the insurance company
would have to pay in order to transfer its obligations immediately
to another insurance company.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-04-10%20173239.png" class="center"><p>
Solvency II requires that technical provisions be calculated as the
sum of the best estimate of the liability and a risk margin to cover
the cost of the capital another insurer would need to hold to take on
the liability.
</p>

<p>
So you see the first bridge. The concept of risk margin is the
pillar of both methodologies, when transferring claims to other
insurances in case of stress.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org73a6de1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org73a6de1">ORSA</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org73a6de1">
<p>
So this is an interesting component of solvency II. Did not find it
that far in SST.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that through such <code>Own Risk and Solvency Assessment</code>
you:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
will cover not just the current risk profile and governance
arrangements, but how these might change going forward, in the light
of the commercial and strategic intentions of the insurer and the
nature of the risks being run
</p>

<p>
Understanding the evolution of an insurer’s balance sheet requires
technical expertise in modelling as well as a <i>deep understanding of
risk and other influences on insurance cash flows</i>.
</p>

<p>
A robust and effective ORSA process will require input from technical
experts who are not just able to meet the intellectual and technical
challenges of the work, but who are also able to communicate the key
technical considerations and translate the output into implications
for potential strategy and business decisions
</p>

<h2 id="org5fe3cd2">Important Notes from the KPMG paper</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5fe3cd2">
<p>
Note that this paper was in fact what I was looking for.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the various solvency regulations for the
insurance companies it starts from the scratch and it gives a solid
overview about the general business model and risk of insurances.
</p>

<p>
So that is actually cool as like this you can continue to make order
and understand what is around you at a larger scope. This will help
you to set things in perspective and will help you to understand the
<i>why</i> of certain things and understand <i>where</i> they are coming.

<h3 id="orgc6defa1">On a note about risk transfer products</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc6defa1">
<p>
Check at the following points:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The use of alternative risk transfer products can produce significant
financial impacts, which can be difficult to assess unless accounting
treatments are appropriate and disclosures are sufficient. It is
important to separate those contracts which provide genuine risk
mitigation from those which seek to create regulatory arbitrage
through financing and other arrangements.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Understand what is what in your system. Cause you have a component
that goes into that dimension. Understand if there is a distinction
for such risk transfer instruments.

<h4 id="org2a9749d">Practical Issues in Setting up proper risk models</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2a9749d">
<blockquote>
<p>
The main practical issue is the quality and ease of use of these
models. Typically companies use a financial model that is not
connected to the main accounting system, although some are able to use
the same system that they use for budgeting and financial
planning. For example, the Canadian experience was that the
implementation of DCAT models was normally done by establishing a
stand-alone computer model, most often using microcomputer templates,
rather than by major system changes to extend the existing main
accounting and statistical systems.

gone by, but I must say that part of it is still quite relevant.

<h4 id="org80e270c">Risks in terms of Balance Sheets</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org80e270c">
<blockquote>
<p>
The principal risk in non-life insurance business is that claims
incurred will be greater than expected. In <b>balance sheet terms</b>, this
is the risk that the provisions will be insufficient to meet claims
payable.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also interesting is the benchmark with Banking
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the banking sector the principal risk is that losses will be
greater than expected. Whilst the liabilities of a bank are generally
fixed and known there is generally no concept of dynamic provisioning
in the banking market which would create provisions for future losses
or claims. Additional uncertainty exists in banks where they write
derivatives or option contracts. There are now well established
mathematical processes for estimating the risk, by measuring the price
volatility of the underlying instrument or exchange rate.

<h4 id="org0e636b3">Chapter 8 - Impact of changes in accounting standards</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0e636b3">
<p>
This must be an interesting chapter. There is now a lot of buzz
about IFRS 19.
</p>

<p>
The conceptual idea is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Accounting is <b>fundamental to any solvency system</b> as accounting
requirements drive the net assets position in the financial statements
which is usually the starting point for the solvency system.
</p>

<p>
Under the current European system, changes in accounting rules for
technical provisions will also impact on the calculation of the
solvency margin requirement. (DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS UP TO DATE - QUITE
OLD PAPER - IN ANY CASE NICE SUCH PAPERS AS THEY GIVE PERSPECTIVE)
