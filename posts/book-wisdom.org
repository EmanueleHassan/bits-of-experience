This posts contains some quotes that I liked when reading books.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

#+begin_quote
True friendships are acquired only in youth, and views or ideas cannot
harm them.

On the contrary, the older a person gets, forces from deep within him
take him back more and more into the world of his boyhood and youth.

(A State at Any Cost - Reconciliation of Zemach and Ben-Gurion).

#+begin_quote
A man is not always rational.

It was not a single thing that broke him in the end, but rather an
entire range of tensions, anxieties, and people, from Lavon to
Kennedy, from Dayan to Nasser. Take all together it was now more than
what he could handle.

(A State at Any Cost - Ben-Gurion motivating his last resignment).

#+begin_quote
He believed that the Jewish people chose God before God chose the
Jews.

"You chose God for yourselves (Joshua 24:22)".

(A State at Any Cost - Ben-Gurion about the meaning of being Jew)
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
I do not believe that God spoke... but I also do not believe that
there are only physical forces in the world.

There is a thing called mind, no matter how it is called, there is
something higher than physical processes, in the entire universe.

(A State at Any Cost - Ben-Gurion on being a different Jew)

The thirst to write is of inestimable power.

(A State at Any Cost - Zemach last written words before dying)
