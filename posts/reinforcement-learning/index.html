<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4140884">
<p>
Here the idea is to play with two opposite forces.
</p>

<p>
Given a problem you are interesting of finding the optimal solution
for it balancing two forces:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>
here the goal is to collect as many data as possible and as wide as
possible in order to explore the problem and all of its possible
outcomes. you don't want to be <b>greedy</b>, i.e. you do not want to use
just immediately available information as the basis of your decision/
i.e. you don't want to make locally optimal choices at each stage but
you rather want to go to the global optimal solution as quickly as
possible.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>exploitation</li>
</ul>
<p>
you don't want to explore states and outcomes that are not beneficial
to you. you have therefore to balance the way in which you explore the
states in such a way that you collect information without harming
yourself too much. 
</p>

<p>
the above is called the <b>exploit-explore-dilemma</b>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbada9b9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbada9b9">Epsilon Greedy Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbada9b9">
<p>
Here the idea is that you take the MLE action maximizing your outcome
(1- ε) of the times. While with ε probability you simply
do something random (i.e. you explore the space in a non-greedy way).
</p>

<p>
The pseudo-code for that would look approximately as this:
</p>

<br><br><img width="100%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-22_um_09.59.32.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
Finally, it is important that even when using this epsilon random
component you might not be interested in exploring the space
continuously. This especially for static problems not evolving over
time.
</p>

<p>
It is namely true, that for such systems you might have explored the
space sufficiently and you observed one particular state to be the
most performing among the many. Then at each exploration you loose
some benefit from deviating from the optimum decision.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore necessary that once you have built up trust and you
deem to have explored the system sufficiently you just focus on the
<b>exploitation</b> component and shrunk your epsilon to zero.
</p>

<p>
You can model the way to do that as needed in your business case.
</p>

<p>
In practice, some ε is often modeled as decaying in
time. I.e. at the beginning you explore the space the most and then
gradually you explore the more and more rarely.

<p>
Define the data generation model for your bandit machine:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>class Bandit:
  def __init__(self, p):
    # p: the win rate
    self.p = p
    self.p_estimate = 0
    self.N = 0
    self.correct = 0

  def pull(self):
    # draw a 1 with probability p
    return np.random.random() &lt; self.p

  def update(self, x):
    self.N +=1
    self.correct += self.pull()

  num_times_explored = 0
  num_times_exploited = 0
  num_optimal = 0
  optimal_j = np.argmax([b.p for b in bandits])
  print("optimal j:", optimal_j)

  for i in range(NUM_TRIALS):

    # use epsilon-greedy to select the next bandit
    if np.random.random() &lt; EPS:
      num_times_explored += 1
      j = np.random.randint(len(bandits))
    else:
      num_times_exploited += 1
      j = np.argmax([b.p_estimate for b in bandits])

    if j == optimal_j:
      num_optimal += 1

    # pull the arm for the bandit with the largest sample
    x = bandits[j].pull()

    # update rewards log
    rewards[i] = x

    # update the distribution for the bandit whose arm we just pulled
    bandits[j].update(x)

  ## log the performance of your epsilon greedy model

  # print mean estimates for each bandit
  for b in bandits:
    print("mean estimate:", b.p_estimate)

  # print total reward
  print("total reward earned:", rewards.sum())
  print("overall win rate:", rewards.sum() / NUM_TRIALS)
  print("num_times_explored:", num_times_explored)
  print("num_times_exploited:", num_times_exploited)
  print("num times selected optimal bandit:", num_optimal)

  # plot the results
  cumulative_rewards = np.cumsum(rewards)
  win_rates = cumulative_rewards / (np.arange(NUM_TRIALS) + 1)

So we are close to the real world means so that we well explored the
states.
</p>

<p>
Moreover our win rate is 0.7235; hence we are not that far from the
CLT average when always selecting the best possible machine. In this
sense the epsilon greedy algorithm performs a good job balancing the
<b>exploitation-exploration trade off</b>.
</p>

<p>
Important in the above is also the choice of the ε
parameter. Here the idea is that if you want to quickly explore the
space and have fast convergence to the most profitable machine then
you have to select a rather big epsilon. In contrast, if you are
willing to slowly reach converge to the optimal machine but have a
long-run cumulative reward (as then the deviation is small) you should
choose a small ε.

<div id="outline-container-org26ee7ce" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org26ee7ce">Optimistic Initial Values Method</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org26ee7ce">
<p>
This is a second approach to deal with the <b>exploitation-exploration
trade-off</b>. The idea here is that instead of starting with an expected
value of zero for the mean reward of each machine you would set very
high values for the expected reward of each machine.
</p>

<p>
By setting a high initial value, the model would try to leverage on
the high expected profit for the particular machine by repeatedly
"exploiting it". It is then true that as time goes by you would
eventually learn the true moment of the machine and the expected gain
would shrink towards the true moment.
</p>

<p>
Important is therefore to understand that for such an algorithm you do
not leverage any random exploration but rather set an initial value
determining the extent to which you would explore a particular
machine. It is straightforward to see that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
the higher the initial value the higher the exploration on a
praticular machine
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, notice that we do not have any consistency property for such
algorithm. I.e. while the estimated mean of each machine converged to
the true mean for the epsilon-greedy algorithm asymptotically, here we
stop to explore a particular machine as soon as its expected mean is
below the one of the other machines. 
</p>

<p>
It is therefore true that as the highest true mean will set an anchor
on the level of the max(expected mean) of the machines we expected
that for different machines the asymptotic mean is below such anchor
but did not converge as we eventually stopped exploring such machines
and converged to the most rewarding machine.

<h3 id="orgc9ff7e3">Upper Confidence Bound</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc9ff7e3">
<p>
This builds on the ideas of optimistic initial value.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to model probabilistically the upper bound instead of
guessing from the CLT property as in the optimistically initial value
algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
The idea here is to choose the machine <code>j</code> not simply by taking the
$max {(expected reward)} $ at any given time, but rather to select the
machine based on the expected reward itself and the measurement error
for the specific machine; i.e. exploit:
</p>

<p>
\[\max{f(\bar{X_{j}}, \epsilon (X_{j}))}\]
</p>

<p>
The question is now on how to model the expected reward.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the authors of such model was the one of leveraging the
<b>Hoeffding's inequality</b> where the bias for your sample estimation
converges exponentially fast to zero.
</p>

<br><br><img width="100%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-22_um_15.35.17.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
You would then get an estimate for your error for a particular machine
at each point of time <code>t</code> by setting the left hand side equation to
some constant and then solving the equation for t. (in order to see
that look at the left hand side inequality in the inequality)
</p>

<p>
It is then possible to see that with p = \(\frac{1}{N^{4}}\) you
would obtain:
</p>

<p>
\[ t = \sqrt{2\frac{log (N)}{n_j}} \]
</p>

<p>
You would then select your most rewarding machine as 
</p>

<p>
\[ j = arg_j \max{\bar{X_j} + \sqrt{2\frac{log (N)}{n_j}}} \]
</p>

<p>
It is then clear from the formula that you would explore more:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a machine that has never been explored</li>

<li>a machine with high expected reward</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that when you sampled enough observations the denominator will
tend to override the effect of the denominator and you would exploit
the highest rewarding machine.

<h3 id="orgf0300c5">Bayesian Bandits - Thompson Sampling Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf0300c5">
<p>
Here the idea is the one to operate in fully bayesian setting. Please
refer to the following notes if you want to <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/pages/papers/#bayesian">well appreciate the
section</a>.
</p>

<p>
The idea here is that instead balancing the exploiting-exploring
trade-off via a probabilistic argument as the one above which
leverages some threshold properties for the expected value bias, you
might well model the prior distribution of each machine as a beta and
the conditional likelihood of the data given the unknown parameter as
a bernoulli. 
</p>

<p>
Where θ represents the true expected reward for the modeled
machine and k<sub>j</sub> represents the number of times the modeled machine was
exploited and therefore the number of observations collected for it.
</p>

<p>
Given that we are dealing here with the beta exponential family it is
easy to show that in such a case the resulting posterior resulting
from the likelihood distribution of the data and the prior is a beta
distribution itself with the following moments:
</p>

<br><br><img width="100%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-22_um_17.48.29.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
and choosing a uninformative prior such as the uniform distribution,
which results in a Beta(1,1) distribution you would get that:
</p>

<br><br><img width="100%" height="100%" src="../../images/Bildschirmfoto_2020-06-22_um_17.55.41.png" class="center"><br><br><p>
Hence you see that the distribution adapts to fit your data.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the Thompson Sampling is now the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>sample from the prior distribution at the first iteration</li>

<li>choose the machine with the highest sample as from 1. (3.) generate a
new posterior for the machine.</li>

<li>sample from the three machine distribution (prior if no data
available) posterior otherwise. go back to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>
From the above you see that as you sample more from the most rewarding
function then your beta parameters adapt. At the beginning as you have
just a few samples and you have no successful draws for machine 1,2
the distribution of them has a distribution with mean &lt; 0.5 and is
strongly skewed in favour of expected reward = 0 where the most of the
samples would generate. I.e. we already tend to exploit the machine
with the highest reward: machine 3.
</p>

<p>
As you get more samples the distributions adapts according to the
data. It is clear that already after 200 samples the distribution for
the third machine is quite concentrated around its mean and therefore
the probability of sampling a higher number for the third machine and
therefore exploiting the third machine is already consistent. In fact
between obs = 200 and obs = 500 we "exploit" the first machine just 2
more times and 7 times the second machine, therefore correctly
exploiting the 3 machine 293/300 times.
