So here a post where you store the different sail types.

You also keep a record of when and how different should be used and
the scope and idea of them.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

* Mainsail

  Nothing to say on this one so far. 


* Jib & Genoa

  This is the front-sail. Note the difference between jib and genoa:

#+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/495px-Jib_vs_genoa.svg.png" class="center">
#+end_export

  The genoa larger surface area increases the speed of the craft in
  light to moderate winds.

  Maximizing the sail area can cause more difficult handling. It may
  be harder to tack a genoa than a jib, since the overlapping area can
  become fouled among the shrouds and/or mast unless carefully tended
  during the tack.

  Genoas are very popular in some racing classes, since they count
  only the foretriangle area when calculating foresail size; a genoa
  allows a significant increase in actual sail area within the
  calculated sail area. [[https://www.yachtsandyachting.com/news/224302/Calculating-your-sail-areas][Check at this to understand]].
  
* Mizzen Staysail

  Basically you need to be on a Yawl for using this.

  You used it on the Ella. It is called carbonera in italian.

  Usually told to be used for stability. Found [[https://www.riggingdoctor.com/life-aboard/2019/5/22/mizzen-staysail][this article]] though.

  Do more reasearch in time on this one.

* Spinnaker

  Basically this is a parachute you put on the bow of your boat.

  For sure one of the most beautiful to see.

  
  #+begin_export html
<img src="../../images/spinnaker.jfif" class="center">
  #+end_export


  You use it with wind in your tail - 90-180 degrees off the bow.

  This is *symmeteric* and it has implications in terms that you may
  not use properly the side-wind and the venturi stuff. So here the
  more tail wind you have the better.

  For this reason teh Gennaker was developed.     

* Gennaker

  There is an *asymmetric sail* and is something in between a Genoa
  and a Spinnaker.
  
  #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/gennaker.jpg" class="center">
  #+end_export

  A gennaker is cut asymmetrically. The neck on the luff is firmly
  attached to the bow, or better yet, to the bowsprit, the two sheets
  to the clew, and clearly the halyard to the head.

  Due to its asymmetrical design, you can *sail higher upwind with
  gennaker than with a spinnaker*, although the sail area is almost the
  same. However, also not as low downwind as with a spinnaker.

  The gennaker is perfect for long space courses with a *wind angle in
  medium winds between 90 and 140 degrees*.
