This post deals with music theory.

Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 

But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.

This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 

The general idea - in music and life is the following:

#+begin_quote
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.

[... But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.

[...] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
#+end_quote

This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 

After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.

** On Intervals

   Everything in music can be reduced to intervals (or distances
   between notes) and their relationships.

*** On Sound

    Recall all of the physics is contained in music:

    #+begin_quote
    Everything in nature is energy vibrating at different frequencies.
    #+end_quote

    So is sound - it is waves travelling through a medium - often
    air. A specific sound has a pitch (the wavelength) - measuring the
    frequency of the sound - and an amplitude - measuring the strength
    of the sound.

    #+end_export

    Recall as well that the human being has the capacity of hearing
    sound in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. You always move in this
    space so to say.

    A note is then a specific named pitch. Aside from the pitch, notes
    have other defining qualities - such as: *time duration*,
    *loudness* and *quality*.

    On the top of it you have the concept of *timbre*. This is a sound
    color that comes from different instruments. For instance, a C
    note on a piano is the same as a C note on a violin but we
    experience them differently due to the different timbre.

    *Important:* what we hear as a single note is actually a /whole
    spectrum/ of related higher frequencies coming from the
    instrument, that our ears perceive, more or less, as a single
    frequency. This is part of the reason why different instruments
    have different /timbres/.


*** On Intervals

    In a sense, studying harmony and melody boils down to studying
    pitch and the relationships between different pitches.

    The relationships between pitches are called intervals.

   
*** On Notes
    
    There are *12* notes in Western music.
    
    #+begin_quote
    A, A# or Bb, B, C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, E, F, F# or Gb, G, G#
    #+end_quote

    As you are learning the piano now - make sure you have the system
    well in your mind. 

    Note as well that there are no sharps or flats between B-C and
    E-F. Once you have this well into your mind it will help you to
    quickly find your way on the piano and will help you to navigate
    the octaves and the different notes positions quickly.

    /Exercise/: try to make sense of it at some stage and understand
    why it turned out exactly like this.
   
    Note as well that the notes without sharps or flats are called
    *natural notes* in western tradition.

    Keep in mind the note circle in this sense. You will have to work
    with it - it hides the structure of the tetrahedron that you still
    have to figure out.

    #+end_export

    Note that when you move clockwise you go higher in pitch. You use
    the sharp notation in this case (#). When you move
    counterclockwise you go lower in pitch. You use the flat notation
    in this case (b).


*** On Registers

    Note that in western music you have 12 notes. These cover the
    entire spectrum of listenable sound 20 Hz - 20 kHz.

    In this sense notes are repeated in *higher and lower registers*.
    You are very familiar with the concept simply by checking at a
    piano.

    Note that the distance between two notes in adjacents registers is
    *an octave*.

    Note that two notes distanced by an octave have the property that
    taking a starting and ending point the amount of waves halves /
    doubles exactly.

*** 


***** TODO understand the following

      Q: what is the definition of note then? Check at the image on
      page 25. There are some places where the waves reach the same
      level. But this one I guess with any note.

      So it must be something about the major ratios. You have to
      think more in these schema.
