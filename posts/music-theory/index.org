This post deals with music theory.

Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 

But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.

This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 

The general idea - in music and life is the following:

#+begin_quote
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.

[... But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.

[...] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
#+end_quote

This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 

After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.

** On Intervals

   Everything in music can be reduced to intervals (or distances
   between notes) and their relationships.

*** On Sound

    Recall all of the physics is contained in music:

    #+begin_quote
    Everything in nature is energy vibrating at different frequencies.
    #+end_quote

    So is sound - it is waves travelling through a medium - often
    air. A specific sound has a pitch (the wavelength) - measuring the
    frequency of the sound - and an amplitude - measuring the strength
    of the sound.
   
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-01-22 210323.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    Recall as well that the human being has the capacity of hearing
    sound in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. You always move in this
    space so to say.

    A note is then a specific named pitch. Aside from the pitch, notes
    have other defining qualities - such as: *time duration*,
    *loudness* and *quality*.

    On the top of it you have the concept of *timbre*. This is a sound
    color that comes from different instruments. For instance, a C
    note on a piano is the same as a C note on a violin but we
    experience them differently due to the different timbre.

    *Important:* what we hear as a single note is actually a /whole
    spectrum/ of related higher frequencies coming from the
    instrument, that our ears perceive, more or less, as a single
    frequency. This is part of the reason why different instruments
    have different /timbres/.


*** On Intervals

    In a sense, studying harmony and melody boils down to studying
    pitch and the relationships between different pitches.

    The relationships between pitches are called intervals.

   
*** On Notes
    
    There are *12* notes in Western music.
    
    #+begin_quote
    A, A# or Bb, B, C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, E, F, F# or Gb, G, G#
    #+end_quote

    As you are learning the piano now - make sure you have the system
    well in your mind. 

    Note as well that there are no sharps or flats between B-C and
    E-F. Once you have this well into your mind it will help you to
    quickly find your way on the piano and will help you to navigate
    the octaves and the different notes positions quickly.

    /Exercise/: try to make sense of it at some stage and understand
    why it turned out exactly like this.
   
    Note as well that the notes without sharps or flats are called
    *natural notes* in western tradition.

    Keep in mind the note circle in this sense. You will have to work
    with it - it hides the structure of the tetrahedron that you still
    have to figure out.
    
    #+begin_export html

    #+end_export

    Note that when you move clockwise you go higher in pitch. You use
    the sharp notation in this case (#). When you move
    counterclockwise you go lower in pitch. You use the flat notation
    in this case (b).


*** On Registers

    Note that in western music you have 12 notes. These cover the
    entire spectrum of listenable sound 20 Hz - 20 kHz.

    In this sense notes are repeated in *higher and lower registers*.
    You are very familiar with the concept simply by checking at a
    piano.

    Note that the distance between two notes in adjacents registers is
    *an octave*.

    Note that two notes distanced by an octave have the property that
    taking a starting and ending point the amount of waves halves /
    doubles exactly.

*** On the C note

    The C note became important because it came to be the only note
    that produces a key comprised of *only natural notes*.

    
**** TODO understand better what this exactly means

*** Tuning note

    Musicians needed some standard at some point to tune their
    instruments and play together based on some reference value.

    This brought up the concept of Standard Pitch or Concert Pitch.

    This sets the A note above middle C (C4) to vibrate at 440 Hz. 

**** TODO try to understand why this came to be as well.


** On Temperaments

*** On the 12-tone equal temperament and octave subdivision

    Note that once you have a tuning note set to some frequency the
    question is on how to divide the frequency notes in an octave.

    Here comes in the idea of equal temperament. 

    You have 12 notes in an octave considering the sharps and
    flats. The idea is then to divide the range of an octave given by
    the ratios of 2 into 12 equal components.

    *Each components equals a semitone*.

    You will see then why you have two times two notes without a sharp
    or a flat. This in order to stay with *6 tones for an octave* but
    keep the 7 distinct natural notes.

    Note that above it is stated that the octave is divided into 12
    equal parts. How the "equality" is defined is tricky. It is not
    equal in the *linear* scala but rather in the *logarithmic* scala.

    Think about this; would it be linear you would divide the 2-factor
    interval between two "equal" notes in the following way:

    2/12 = 1/6 = 0.166666...

    Meaning each note would be would distanced by a factor: 1.1666666

    But the 12 - TET divides the two factor interval in the following
    way:

    12th root of 2 = 1.059463.... (irrational number)

    So understand that the distance between two numbers increases
    logarithmically by this factor.

**** TODO Understand the distinction among natural notes and sharps

     What defines exactly the characterization?



**** TODO one trillion dollar question: why this irrational number

     Try to see if it also present somewhere else in nature etc.

*** Overtone Series and Just Intonation

    Note that this was the standard before the 12-TET system came into
    being. 

    It is based on the *harmonic or overtone series*.

    This as the square root of two and five and the golden
    ratio. There is structure in the universe if you train your 
    eye to see it. 

    The harmonic series is defined in the following way and the sound
    produced by playing one note creates a series of overtone waves
    represented by the harmonic fractions in the harmonic series.
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-02-15 211524.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    Understand that the waves of overtone are shorter in wavelength as
    characterized by the harmonic fractions. In this sense
    *over*-tone.

    Understand as well that the term *harmonic* series actually
    derives from the overtone series. These are harmonic.
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-02-15 212019.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    Finally, note that architects made use of such harmonic
    proportions in the Baroque period. Many buildings of that period
    where constructed following such harmonic series. 

    You see once more how architect try to bring harmony in their
    buildings. Be it via the golden ratio or such series. 

    To sum up overtone series represents the naturally occurring
    frequencies based on the intervals that *resonate perfectly* with
    the initial fundamental note.

    Note that different instruments have different amplitudes for
    different harmonic series this is what ultimately constitutes the
    timbre of an instrument. You can watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbLYD9KFAo][following video]] to get
    an idea.

    Finally, note that how overtones series and their implied
    intervals to the fundamental note define Perfect, Major and Minor
    proportions depending how the overtone interacts with the
    fundamental note. [[https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/canyoufeelthelovetonight.html][There's a rhyme and rhythm to the wild
    outdoors]]. 

    Given the above discussion it is easy to see how the just
    intonation divides an octave.

    Recall that you have 12 notes in EU musical system. Then basically
    you can divide the interval between two notes via harmonic series.

    I.e. the distances between notes (=intervals) are represented by
    the ratios of the harmonic series such that:

    - A4 = 440 Hz

    - A5 = 880 Hz = 1:2 distance

    - E5 2/3 = 440  (Harmonic Series) = Meaning subtracting 1:3 of the
                                        new note will bring you to the root.

             = (440 / 2) * 3  = 660 Hz

    - D5 4/5 = 440 = 587.33 Hz

    - Etc. etc.

    Interesting is to note the vicinity of the tone equal temperament
    and the just intonation numbers.
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-02-15 221919.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    There seems to be *a relation between the 12th root of 2 and the
    first 12 elements in the harmonic series*. 

    
*** TODO tempering the beats

    You can find it in your book on page 44. 

    You have to have a more profound knowledge of music to really make
    sense of this section.

    Come back to it at a later stage.  

*** TODO Well Tempered

    Come back to it when you do the tempering the beats part. Just
    understand it by now as another way to divide the scala that was
    designed to more closely approximate the overtone intervals in
    Just Intonation, while still allowing keyboards and fretted
    instruments to sound more or less good in all keys.

*** TODO Pythagorean Tuning System

    Understand it in relation to the pythagorean math.

** Intervals
   
   The idea here is that the absolute does not count. The distance
   does. Such distances among notes are called intervals.

   It can be said that all music theory is based around studying
   intervals and how they make up music and affect our emotions.

   You can check [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDIm_2qS5s][this video]] to get a taste of it.

   Note that the perfect 5th represents the ratio 1:3 in the harmonic
   series. The perfect 4th the ratio 1:4. Finally 1:5 series
   represents the major 3rd.

   In general note that the *perfect* intervals are more *stable and
   safe*. This is how you can recognize them. Anytime a musical melody
   ventures a bit, it can return to a safe and stable sound coming to
   a note that is some Perfect interval apart.

   As we move away from perfect intervals - we are moving away from
   home, thus producing more dissonance. This creates movement and
   build up tension and friction that tends to resolve to a home
   sounding note.


*** Chromatic and Diatonic Intervals

    Intervals are grouped. Two important groups worth to mention are
    the chromomatic intervals and the diatonic intervals.

    The chromatic intervals contain all of the 12 intervals.

    The diatonic intervals contain: Major and Perfect Intervals. These
    are important cause their intervals define the Major scale. This
    is the most fundamental scale in western music as we will see.

** Harmony, Melody and Rhythm

   Note that the three define the lattice in which the music lives. 

   The *rhythm* is the *relationship between sounds and their duration*
   without respect to their pitches.

   The *harmony* of a piece is the way the *notes in a piece would sound
   if they were to be played simultaneously*. Think about it as playing
   the relevant notes as in a chord. 

   I.e. when focusing on the vertical structure between pitches
   (=harmony) you are treating them as though they were happening at
   the same time (even if they are happening one after another).

   The *melody* of a piece is how notes sound in sequence. *Melody* is all
   about *how notes sound together in a sequence*. 

   Note that two pieces could have the same harmonic value but a
   different melodic value, given that the notes might occur in a
   different sequence.

   Note that so far it was not understood what makes up a nice
   melody. But what was understood is the importance of dynergic
   structure. I.e. it is important that the melody moves and unfolds;
   build up tension and releases. That means that a good melody moves
   away from the harmonic center; builds up tension; and then moves
   back in some form to it; releasing the tension.

   In this sense; it is similar to good sex. In any case there is no
   major formula for it. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNwnlBVg09Q][Each child is drumming his own way]] after all.
