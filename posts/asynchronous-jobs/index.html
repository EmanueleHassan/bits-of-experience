<p>
So new post.
</p>

<p>
This is mainly about some integration exercise. It is not simple to
set up properly integration patterns. You can refer to <a href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/index.html">the following</a>
for a general overview.
</p>

<p>
So let's start to explore.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
So the basic idea is to create an integration pattern via
asynchronous API calls.
</p>

<p>
So you will need to pieces:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>code implementation to work with that mental framework</li>

<li>asynchronous API documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>
The next two chapters deal with it.
</p>

<p>
(Update as of 10-03 - actually the best way to work in such an
asychronous way is through a ractive programming model. Check at your
notes in <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/spring/">here</a> - chapter on reactive programming. Note however that
you will not be able to write full reactive programs as the relational
model and JDBC is not being rewritten in a reactive way yet.)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3220f08" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3220f08">Asynchronous API - Documentation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3220f08">
<p>
Apparently there is an OpenAPI counterpart for async communication.
</p>

<p>
I mean you could simply document your endpoints with OpenAPI and
keep the structure of the async communication in some documentation
somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
I like in any case the idea of using a standard. Computer science is
fun and you have to leverage on such big projects as then you can
see that there are options to visulize this general asynch
communication and more likely many other projects will start to
emerge as this is just the beginning of the entire thingy. 
</p>

<p>
Check <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/hello-world">this</a>. You see that it is a quite intuitive scema.
</p>

<p>
Read into it <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/asyncapi_codegen_scst">here</a> to get an idea of where the market is already
moving.
</p>

<p>
I think that this will come with time. Baby steps as always. Start
easy - then expand on it. Sooner or later you will start in any case
to work more with event-driven architectures. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org98e7395" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org98e7395">Coding and Designing Asynchronous Communication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org98e7395">
<p>
So basically there are two options:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>polling</li>

<li>callback</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can briefly read about the two <a href="https://sanketdaru.com/blog/polling-model-async-rest-spring-boot/">here</a>. It is clear now that the
most elegant option is the second one.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org438cc38" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org438cc38">Polling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org438cc38">
<p>
W.r.t. polling you can see the following two sources:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://sanketdaru.com/blog/polling-model-async-rest-spring-boot/">source 1</a></li>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/PheaSoy/spring-boot-async-callback">source 2</a> - note that name is misleading it is still mostly a
polling solution in my view.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb116668" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb116668">Callback</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb116668">
<p>
You can easily create callbacks with a seris of endpoints and
multi-threading on your machines.
</p>

<p>
A more solid way is to work with queues. Then you do not have to go
on multi-threading necessarily. This might simplify extensively the
development task at the cost of some resources loss.
</p>

<p>
You can then integrate queues with event-grids in order to create a
fully reactive architecture for your application that is not
polled operations dependent.
</p>

<p>
I.e. in comparison to <a href="https://github.com/PheaSoy/spring-boot-async-callback">source 2</a> you do not have the client to
continuously ask for the feedback and check if execution completed.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7db9d42">
<img src="../../images/callbackAsync.png" class="center"><p>
I mean so you see that at conceptual level it is not that difficult
to set up a solution performing your desired solutions.
</p>

<p>
Have just to read a bit into it - but basically you are very much
done.
</p>

<p>
You can read over <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-scale-microservices-with-message-queues-spring-boot-and-kubernetes-f691b7ba3acf/">here</a> a basic example for such a similar solution
going more in the technological component. Note that you will
not be able to apply the exact same tech stack but the idea is
there and it is quite similar to what you had in mind. 
</p>

<p>
Another <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/auto-scale-rabbitmq-consumers-by-queue-size-on-openshift/">source</a> for making that pattern.

<div id="outline-container-orgde6ec3f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgde6ec3f">Second round of Thinking - gathering evidence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde6ec3f">
<p>
So the one above was a basic idea.
</p>

<p>
I think you have the general structure in mind. Have to become more
concrete now.
</p>

<p>
Explore better the available services in Azure and start to create
a solid architecture for it.
</p>

<p>
I.e. slowly start as well talks with your peers to see what is
doable and what is not.
</p>

<p>
Basic architectural patterns that you should consider for your
asynchronous messages are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/messaging">the following</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4940e6f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4940e6f">Request-Reply Pattern</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4940e6f">
<p>
Essentially what you aim to set up is an async request-reply
integration pattern.
</p>

<p>
You can read about it over <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply">here</a>. There in the context and problem
you can see your exact situation and see how a queue is often the
solution architecture of choice for this kind of situations.
</p>

<p>
Note that the queue must be integrated with a status check.
</p>

<p>
You can see the most basic architecture to set something like this
up <a href="https://reflectoring.io/amqp-request-response/">here</a>. I think this is quite basic and I will try to construct a
more solid architecture next. 
</p>

<p>
This is what I will develop on in the next sections.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67302e8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org67302e8">Service Bus</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org67302e8">
<p>
This is a queue service in Azure. So it is a managed queue that it
is easy to interact with.
</p>

<p>
If you want to go fully open source check the resources
above. Note as well that service bus is quite a simple message
broker. I understand that it does not allow neither the
flexibility of an exchange as RabbitMQ nor the resiliency of the
cluster topology of Kafka. (See quick notes <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/spring/">here</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Important points for it are mentioned next. 
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a id="org7818e0c"></a>On operating the messages in a queue<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7818e0c">
<p>
So essentially understand the following basic operations you can
do with it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>get messages from queue</li>

<li>delete messages from queue</li>

<li>peek messages from queue</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a id="org8845055"></a>Getting the Messages<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8845055">
<p>
Check at the following get operation for a message in the queue.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When a message is retrieved from the queue, the response includes
the message and a pop receipt value, which is required to delete the
message (have an API call for it).
</p>

<p>
The message is <b>not automatically deleted from the queue</b>, but after
it has been retrieved, it is <b>not visible to other clients</b> for the time
interval specified by the <b>visibilitytimeout parameter</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that upon getting a message from the queue the <code>delivery
     count</code> is increased. This is of paramount importance to deal with
faulty messages and a first class citizen for the concept of <a href="#org97bc4a4">Dead
Latter</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So in this way you can keep track of what was processed and what
still needs to be processed. You have a state machine as long as
the queue is reliable. Have to discuss with V. in this sense to
question how important is that 0.01% of non-availability. I guess
that for us is not a major concern as worst you do the operation
again. Have to have a logging mechanismus keeping track of
everything nonetheless. 
</p>

<p>
Now the only thing is that in such a way you need polling from
the queue.
</p>

<p>
The other possibility is to set an event-grid or an azure
function trigger in between.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a id="org6081abf"></a>Peeking the Messages<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6081abf">
<p>
This function essentially works as the get orperator with the
difference that <code>delivery count</code> is <b>not increased</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Service Bus allows a consumer to peek the queue and lock a message
from other consumers.
</p>

<p>
It's the responsibility of the consumer to <b>report the processing
status</b> of the message.
</p>

<p>
Only when the consumer marks the message as consumed, Service Bus
removes the message from the queue.
</p>

<p>
If a failure, timeout, or crash occurs, Service Bus unlocks the
message so that other consumers can retrieve it. This way messages
aren't lost in transfer.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a id="orgdfe8d86"></a>Deleting the Messages<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdfe8d86">
<p>
As mentioned above in the two cases what you actually do in the
above is reading messages out of the queue.
</p>

<p>
You do not delete such from there. You just acquire a lock over
them for a limited amount of time.
</p>

<p>
Then you have to manually delete upon the successful processing
of a message.
</p>

<p>
You can well understand that this is very good as in such a case
you have an actual state machine about the messages that are
still to be completed.
</p>

<p>
The question is rather how you log finished jobs. I guess that
you are still interested in keeping track of that.
</p>

<p>
Need to couple the thing with a store then.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a id="org97bc4a4"></a>Dead Latter<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org97bc4a4">
<p>
See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dead-letter-queues">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is essentially a queue within the queue where unprocessed or
errors-bounded messages are being stored.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple reasons that make messages qualify as
dead-latter messages.
</p>

<p>
The most interesting one - among the many others - for your
application logic is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
Maximum delivery count
</p>

<p>
Recall that when you get the message out of the queue its count-value
is incremented by one.
</p>

<p>
Then after a given amount of times that you tried to process
the message without success… i.e. when the count value is
large enough - you start to push the message 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a id="orged9fc9b"></a>Note that there are ways to inspect the size of your queue<br>
</li>

<li>
<a id="org1cde5fa"></a>Check-pointing for long running jobs<br><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1cde5fa">
<p>
That is exactly the other bit that you need.
</p>

<p>
You can set the state for a session and get the state.
</p>

<p>
So with it you would already have a solution for the UI to get
the relevant information about the processing status of a job.
</p>

<p>

If you go for a push model you have to solve the following points:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pushing out of the queue - how do you trigger the eventGrid
event if the message in the queue was not processed?</li>

<li>polling you can do it yourself by implementing ETL jobs pulling
out from the queue. See the basic API of the bus.</li>

<li>
<p>
check as well the option to work with Azure functions. It
probably makes most sense to work in such a way.
</p>

<p>
Check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-storage-blob-triggered-function">this documentation</a> in this sense. (actually the event Grid
also mentioned <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47570207/message-from-azure-blob-storage-to-azure-service-bus">here</a>). So in any case you are on the right track
to construct your solution architecture. Check at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-storage-queue-triggered-function">this</a>
documentation.
</p>

<h2 id="orge17657e">On Azure Functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge17657e">
<p>
Very nice way to integrate with the two services you want to use:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blob</li>

<li>Service Bus</li>
</ul>
<p>
Check here the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-service-bus">possible triggers</a>.
</p>

<p>
In such a way you do not have to go Premium on Event Grid and I
think that for the extent of our workloads it is more than enough to
work in such a way without going too big on services.
</p>

<p>
Start to test your workflow with Azure Functions Core Tools as soon
as you get the green light from IT to install it.

<div id="outline-container-org37f007a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org37f007a">Circuit Breaker</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org37f007a">
<p>
This is an important concept that you have to keep in mind when
you develop your distributed system solution. 
</p>

<p>
The idea is that as information is more distributed it might be
more difficult to revert a given app bit of logic in case of
errors.
</p>

<p>
So you have always to keep in mind how to break the circuit in
case of faults and how to revert every distributed component
affected.
</p>

<p>
You might as well think in terms of <b>compensating transaction</b>
patterns.
</p>

<p>
What is needed to track and trigger compensating transactions?
</p>

<p>
This is in fact probably the one and major issue of setting up
everything properly in a distributed system way. All the rest is a
gain in my humble opinion. Especially on the long run. 
</p>

<p>
Note that you can use DBs to manage state. You can think for
instance of the solution
</p>

<p>
Another possibility - and this a thing that in any case you will
have to dig more into it - is the one of using frameworks as
<a href="#org7dd823f">Jaeger</a>.
</p>

<p>
This might help you not simply for circuit breakers but as well to
debug a distributed application and understand where issues and
triggers are.
