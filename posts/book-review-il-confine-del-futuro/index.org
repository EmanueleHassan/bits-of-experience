#+END_COMMENT

   So I recently finished the books I was reading. I was out of books
   and did not want to go buy some in a book-shop; here they mostly
   sell books in German and I rather prefer to read books in
   English...

   So I started to search in my room where I found the book - Il
   Confine del Futuro - a book by an IBM Research Scientist about
   Artificial Intelligence my family gave me about 2 years ago; when
   they got that I was interested in the subject.

   It was nice of them - I even found some writings wishing me good
   luck for the new adventure - each in his personal way reflecting
   the character... Was nice and fun to read them.

   Anyways... I did not read it at first... the title sounded too
   vague. The classical book leveraging the buzz, trying to outline and
   solve questions for which there is no answer.

   Being the left-over I started to read it and in two evenings I was
   over with it. It is quite some light book that you can go over
   quickly. Here my sum-up.

{{{TEASER_END}}}


  - [[https://www.amazon.de/confine-del-futuro-dellintelligenza-artificiale-ebook/dp/B07P5TVJVB][Il Confine del Futuro]] (Francesca Rossi):

    So particular book. If you want to go in the nitty-gritty of the
    topic that is not the right book for you. It is quite high-level
    and this is the reason why it has average reviews on Amazon.

    I must say that I partly agree with the people. On the one hand,
    you can clearly see that the author did not go the extra mile in
    writing the book but simply leveraged the name, the position, and
    the buzz for the topic for selling the book. In this sense there
    is a bit too much of auto-reference that when not backed by
    interesting content might hurt some reader. That was proved by the
    Amazon reviews, nobody likes ego-centric people.

    On the other hand, you might appreciate that is so high
    level. After all the author already excuses at the beginning for
    it and tells the public that is interested in the specifics of the
    subject to search for handbooks somewhere else. I can understand
    it, that is the ultimate difference between a /textbook/ and a
    /book/. Moreover, I think that there is value even in a
    non-obsessed and 100%-effort book or writing. After all, in such a
    way it is possible to write quick and dirty content going to the
    gist of the problem without loosing too much time on petty
    details. Of course you should have the skills to do that but I
    think that the author has the authority to do that.

    In this sense I think that the author manages well to bring some
    /meta-level/ thinking when talking about AI and machine
    learning. This is typical of italian people, we are platonic by
    education.

    When thinking in these terms, I think that it is possible to say
    that it is a good book - it manages well to reach what a textbook
    cannot get - a high level, non-complicated, overview of the topic.

    In this sense, I found of particular interest in the book the
    following elements:

    - the difference between slow and fast thinking.

      I like that differentiation and I never thought about it in such
      an explicit way. [[https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/ID28756725.html][There is a book]] that goes over it - probably I
      should read it nextish.

      That is a very nice concept that I immediately applied to the
      book when reading it. It is kind of interesting how all of the
      concepts expressed in the book are nothing new to anyone working
      or dealing with AI/machine learning/applied
      statistics.

      Nonetheless, we get acquainted about all of that common
      knowledge as a side effect of doing some work; i.e. we get it in
      the fast way of thinking without making it ever explicit. While
      in contrast when you read a 100-pages book expressing all of
      that common knowledge you are forced to start your slow thinking
      process about the topics. Even more when writing a post about it
      later then. This activates an entire different way of thinking
      about it and it raises new consciousness.
     
    - the macro-level differentiation between machine-learning
      (learning by example) and the procedural learning (learning by
      fix-rule).

      I think that this differentiation is of particular importance
      even if the line gets sometimes blurry when you think about
      it. After all everything is a set of instructions - a procedural
      learning - and it is not always as easy the difference. You
      might well think of machine learning algorithms as being
      deterministic, as a well specified set of rules apply to them.

      This is also where I think that the general public confusion
      occurs when talking about black-box.

      A black-box simply occurs when the algorithm is applied to some
      microlevel (say the pixel level), the human is not able to make
      sense of. When human are not able to make sense of the input and
      how it is transformed as we do not find any connection or simple
      storytelling for it, we start to talk about black-box. After all
      I never heard anyone talking about black-box for a regression
      although the mathematical ultimate concept between the
      "black-box neural networks" and regressions is not that far.

      I.e. you talk about black-box when the information extracted out
      of an object is of no practical use for a human being as we are
      not able to make sense of it at any level as we cannot read and
      interpret that piece of information.

      That is the ultimate strength of learning by example and the
      reason for the buzz around machine learning. You allow to
      extract information out of an entire new set of objects, which a
      human being is not able to make any sense of.

      This is the beauty of machine learning and why it is creating so
      much buzz. Not the single individual algorithm. Nor a complex
      mathematical formula in itself. This is an idea that a /book/
      can bring you but a /textbook/ cannot - or at least not in the
      same way as you need a stronger prolonged stimulus to think in
      these term and get out of that micro-level thinking you do in
      your routine when applying such things.

      The issue of these black-box models is then that the human has
      to go by trial and error to learn these patterns. We have to try
      to analyze some microlevel entity and see how it works. You have
      then reached the ultimate pure-black-box level so prone to
      overfitting.

      Finger-crossed: you have no idea of why a result occurred but
      you just hope and make some mathematical tricks that should
      convince you that your results are generalizable and adversarial
      resistant.

    - about the impossibility to distinguish between procedural
      learning and learning by example.

      interesting is that the meta-level that allows a human to get
      the idea of an object, is not known to the human in a procedural
      way. Also interesting is that it is not an example driven
      deducted idea.

      You are able to think in abstract terms - say a yellow hydra
      with the face of a dog - vs [[https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1nGGpfIgXevFXMyR_JFnghK9lAoUeAXeq1u6D8y-k8arlRarloNdoLz4SFyLE-79neRo&usqp=CAU][by example]].

      Or you can get the idea of quadruple out of a cat. This in
      contrast to the case of machine learning where in order to learn
      the idea of quadruple you would have to re-index and retrain all
      of your data and train again a different algorithm for the
      task.. you cannot also ask ML to make a generalization out of a
      category as it has no idea on how to do that.

      Interesting is in this sense to see and think about how we human
      are not even conscious ourselves about some structures of our
      thinking and decision making. We are black-boxes and this is the
      ultimate reason why we need psychologists to remember us such a
      thing and tell us that it is okey.

      However, funny is also the way we cannot accept a black-box
      object, pretending that each and every human decision is
      motivated by pure rational choices. Note that this tendency is
      not just in machine learning but it is pretty much installed in
      the human brain of any western person as a core and fundamental
      fix-point value. 

      Well, I see that I am starting to go too much into philosophical
      discussion. That is dangerous so I will let it and go back to my
      micro-level thinking.

    Cheers & maybe it might be interesting for some other individual
    than me.
