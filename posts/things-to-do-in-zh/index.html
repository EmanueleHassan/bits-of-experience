<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtisel">Shtisel</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
I was home over Easter. I watched with the family the third
season. Very nice series. Much better than <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorthodox_(Miniserie)">unorthodox</a>. There
everything was a little bit too much exasperated.
</p>

<p>
This is nice. I would say it's kosher. It well summarizes the
Jewish mentality with all its pro and cons.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKtvrvZC8OY">Il mondo che vorrei</a> (2021):
</p>

<p>
This was an interview with <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Francesco">Pope Francesco I</a>. It was a good
watch. In a rough world that is hard to navigate is always good to
listen to such people reminding the true christian values on which
the western society build on. These are not values augmenting the
individualism but rather stressing the importance of the community
that we must protect and remind us.
</p>

<p>
The message was centered about fostering a culture of <i>us</i> in
contrast to an <i>egocentric</i> view, in promoting a culture where we
have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhVsgxlYsEA">empathy</a> and care for the others. In refusing a culture of
waste, where if we do not like something, if something creates a
problem or if something/someone does not fit, well we throw it
away, be it a human being or a thing, instead of trying to solve
the problem with it.
</p>

<p>
Good fellow as always Pope Francesco, may he stay healthy.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Island_(film)">L'isola delle rose</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow! What an incredible story. I love it. It is a daydreamer story
like me. Makes well the point of the italian genius. It lives in a
different dimension. We idealist animals…
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En1jkf34xjc">La vita davanti a sé</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Very good movie. Strong like Momo. It is a very mixed movie. It
encompasses many feelings and it is much food for thoughts. There
is not a bottom line to it and it is not a light watch where there
not need to be a bottom line. 
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to write a snippet summarizing it. I liked it. One
of the things I liked was the power of Momo. I guess that a key in
the movie is how the energy of such people when channeled in the
right will make them shine. The weird element of the lion in the
movie goes in this direction. There is a lion / fire in some
people and it can turn to very good or bad outcomes depending on
who is there in the path of such people - be it Madame Rosa or the
other guy.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is also to notice that not the spoiled child, but
rather the suffered one will have the fire. Help such people and
let them shine.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMuQfYdgWxw">Sorelle Macaluso</a> (2020):
</p>

<p>
Wow wow wow!!! There are film directors that do movies. They stay in
the daily life of each of us and touch daily topics. Mundane - I
think this is the word.
</p>

<p>
This transcends everything. What a beautiful mind the one of the
movie director. To get the gravity of the life and what each one
of us needs to face in our life and bring it on the big screen in
such a way is simply… wow. And the lyrics that goes along the
movie. It's liberty music. Despite the hard life we are able to
face it and go on with such a power. Crazy movie. Possibly one of
the best, if not the best I ever saw.
</p>

<p>
And I usually do not touch or go along the female vs male story. I
do not like dichotomies. But damn it you feel the touch of a
female soul in the movie. And if this is what we missed, give way
to the woman on the big screen.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUOH8_HYDtA">Cyrano mon Amour</a> (2019):
</p>

<p>
Good movie. Confirms my personal opinion about French movies:
these are generally the best movies when you look for a light but
tasty watch. The key of the French majesty of movies production is
to bring deep stories in a light way to the viewer while keeping
the importance of the message in the movie.
</p>

<p>
Here and there this specific movie falls into some mainstream,
which might hurt some more sophisticated viewer but generally a
good watch that underlines how sometimes the best in life does not
come by following rigid structures. 
</p>

<p>
Have to watch the Cyrano at some Opernhaus at some point now..
</p>

<p>
Also interesting is that now you can understand better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wnAnIM3cw">the song of
Guccini</a>. I understood the power of the text but some links where
missing and now it clicked.

<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_%26_the_Gun">The Old Man &amp; The Gun</a> (2018):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie and watch. It teaches the importance of elegance and
style in life. That demeanor that everyone wants to have but just
a few achieve. It is funny as basically in the plot the demeanor
of the person completely excuses his acts. You and everyone in the
movie sympathize with him.
</p>

<p>
Just a pity for the end. He did not reach maturity and it lives
you with the doubt that guy was just a psycho. But maybe it was
just in his style and that is the beauty of it. Throwing
everything away to save this little but important thing of
yours.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZxoko_HC0">Green Book</a> (2018):

<p>
Very nice movie. It shows how narrow minded people can easily
be.. Talking and acting just based on habits and norms without
questioning the system and going further. There is a convenience
in doing that, which is undeniable. Best things happen though if
you managed to transcend it.
</p>

<p>
Also very important the motive of dignity in Doc. Shirely.
</p>

<p>
I liked a lot in this sense the quote
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You Never Win With Violence. You Only Win When You Maintain Your Dignity.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
beautiful idea and yet so difficult to maintain.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGzKnyhYDQI">Loving Vincent</a> (2017):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. It is kind of a thriller. Recommended watch, just
because of the particular painting style it is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It is also a nice watch in the sense that you get easily
transported. 
</p>

<p>
Interesting way to talk about Van Gogh in this particular indirect
way. I think at the end they well manage to give a picture of him.

Very nice movie. Extremely funny. I love Manu. But also serious in
the topic. Without ever being too heavy. Very recommended.

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYzFieit8dI">Mayerowitz Stories</a> (2017):

<p>
Well, there are many movies. Some are different. This is one of
these. Some movies you know from the very beginning what it is
gonna come. This not. It evolves and evolves and evolves and then
it finishes.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice family story.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRADS6wT3nc">Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
It talks about a nice story. It is a story about
integration. Again a typical french comedy. Sometimes fun,
sometimes serious and in general a very pleasant and constructive
watch.
</p>

<p>
The message of the story is the usual. But it is always good to
watch one more movie making the point. Myself as emigrant know
the point. Every time when moving out and entering a new
community you will face opposition. Don't think it is personal it
is just how the world spins. And if you are bright enough then you
will have the courage and the duty to oppose such mechanism and
promote different outcomes like the one in the movie. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKYaEPdcV1g&amp;t=3s">War Dogs</a> (2016):
</p>

<p>
Dark comedy crime movie. Interesting cause it is based on a true
story. I generally do not like such kind of movies as they make
the watcher sympathize on bad behaviour by making it <i>hollywood
cool</i>. At the end you enjoy watching it but it is a double edge
sword for the reasons above. If you read it by taking a step back,
there is a learning also in such movie in how even an apparently
good soul as David gets easily tricked by the moment and takes up
bad habits. We all had that kind of Efraim friend.
</p>

<p>
So bottom line always remember that you are walking on thin ice
and it is easy to get out of track. Keep faith and stay solid on
good values. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RI0QvaGoiI">Notting Hill</a> (1999):
</p>

<p>
Nice movie. With the magic British touch. I think that even more
interesting than the classical love story of the movie is the
friendship among the librarian's group of friends.
</p>

<p>
It was so sincere with that British humor. I think that this is
one of the greatest strength of the brits people. They are not
picky and can see tragedies with different lenses.
</p>

<p>
I would sign a paper to be able to make such jokes and laugh with
my dearest friends when life will make me feel miserable. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTfYsODWQo">Stand by me</a> (1986):
</p>

<p>
I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was
twelve. Jesus, does anyone?
</p>

<p>
Good sentence as an end of the movie. Movie telling a simple
story. No big surprises. But still good. This is what simple
stories telling a piece of every child life can achieve. There is
no message but still the story is powerful. And the end makes the
message in the end, with a sentence - at the end. Nice movie.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GzCG6lpFUw&amp;t=57s">Vacanze Romane</a> (1953):
</p>

<p>
Was nice to see such an old movie. The story is outdated as in
2020 no one would ever come up with such a story. These were
rather fights from a previous generation.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe I guess that in some countries you would still have such
a story, what is different however is how the movie would be
interpreted. It would be more scenographic today, the message
would be more aggressive, more direct. 
</p>

<p>
This is a thing that I think got lost with respect to older
movies. They were more elegant and romantic. I do not know if it
was due to the fact that there was a different way to live the
public dimension in that age. They were different and this
difference emerges when watching such an old movie.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of my grand-dad, he used to have some of this
gentleman demeanor that is a leitmotiv in the movie. It got lost,
for better or for worse, replaced by a young wilder generation.

<a href="https://www.amazon.de/confine-del-futuro-dellintelligenza-artificiale-ebook/dp/B07P5TVJVB">Il Confine del Futuro</a> (Francesca Rossi):
</p>

<p>
So particular book. If you want to go in the nitty-gritty of the
topic that is not the right book for you. It is quite high-level
and this is the reason why it has average reviews on Amazon.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I partly agree with the people. On the one hand,
you can clearly see that the author did not go the extra mile in
writing the book but simply leveraged the name, the position, and
the buzz for the topic for selling the book. In this sense there
is a bit too much of auto-reference that when not backed by
interesting content might hurt some reader. That was proved by the
Amazon reviews, nobody likes ego-centric people.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, you might appreciate that is so high
level. After all the author already excuses at the beginning for
it and tells the public that is interested in the specifics of the
subject to search for handbooks somewhere else. I can understand
it, that is the ultimate difference between a <i>textbook</i> and a
<i>book</i>. Moreover, I think that there is value even in a
non-obsessed and 100%-effort book or writing. After all, in such a
way it is possible to write quick and dirty content going to the
gist of the problem without loosing too much time on petty
details. Of course you should have the skills to do that but I
think that the author has the authority to do that.
</p>

<p>
In this sense I think that the author manages well to bring some
<i>meta-level</i> thinking when talking about AI and machine
learning. This is typical of italian people, we are platonic by
education.
</p>

<p>
When thinking in these terms, I think that it is possible to say
that it is a good book - it manages well to reach what a textbook
cannot get - a high level, non-complicated, overview of the topic.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, I found of particular interest in the book the
following elements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
the difference between slow and fast thinking.
</p>

<p>
I like that differentiation and I never thought about it in such
an explicit way. <a href="https://www.orellfuessli.ch/shop/home/artikeldetails/ID28756725.html">There is a book</a> that goes over it - probably I
should read it nextish.
</p>

<p>
That is a very nice concept that I immediately applied to the
book when reading it. It is kind of interesting how all of the
concepts expressed in the book are nothing new to anyone working
or dealing with AI/machine learning/applied
statistics.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we get acquainted about all of that common
knowledge as a side effect of doing some work; i.e. we get it in
the fast way of thinking without making it ever explicit. While
in contrast when you read a 100-pages book expressing all of
that common knowledge you are forced to start your slow thinking
process about the topics. Even more when writing a post about it
later then. This activates an entire different way of thinking
about it and it raises new consciousness.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
the macro-level differentiation between machine-learning
(learning by example) and the procedural learning (learning by
fix-rule).
</p>

<p>
I think that this differentiation is of particular importance
even if the line gets sometimes blurry when you think about
it. After all everything is a set of instructions - a procedural
learning - and it is not always as easy the difference. You
might well think of machine learning algorithms as being
deterministic, as a well specified set of rules apply to them.
</p>

<p>
This is also where I think that the general public confusion
occurs when talking about black-box.
</p>

<p>
A black-box simply occurs when the algorithm is applied to some
microlevel (say the pixel level), the human is not able to make
sense of. When human are not able to make sense of the input and
how it is transformed as we do not find any connection or simple
storytelling for it, we start to talk about black-box. After all
I never heard anyone talking about black-box for a regression
although the mathematical ultimate concept between the
"black-box neural networks" and regressions is not that far.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you talk about black-box when the information extracted out
of an object is of no practical use for a human being as we are
not able to make sense of it at any level as we cannot read and
interpret that piece of information.
</p>

<p>
That is the ultimate strength of learning by example and the
reason for the buzz around machine learning. You allow to
extract information out of an entire new set of objects, which a
human being is not able to make any sense of.
</p>

<p>
This is the beauty of machine learning and why it is creating so
much buzz. Not the single individual algorithm. Nor a complex
mathematical formula in itself. This is an idea that a <i>book</i>
can bring you but a <i>textbook</i> cannot - or at least not in the
same way as you need a stronger prolonged stimulus to think in
these term and get out of that micro-level thinking you do in
your routine when applying such things.
</p>

<p>
The issue of these black-box models is then that the human has
to go by trial and error to learn these patterns. We have to try
to analyze some microlevel entity and see how it works. You have
then reached the ultimate pure-black-box level so prone to
overfitting.
</p>

<p>
Finger-crossed: you have no idea of why a result occurred but
you just hope and make some mathematical tricks that should
convince you that your results are generalizable and adversarial
resistant.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
about the impossibility to distinguish between procedural
learning and learning by example.
</p>

<p>
interesting is that the meta-level that allows a human to get
the idea of an object, is not known to the human in a procedural
way. Also interesting is that it is not an example driven
deducted idea.
</p>

<p>
You are able to think in abstract terms - say a yellow hydra
with the face of a dog - vs <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1nGGpfIgXevFXMyR_JFnghK9lAoUeAXeq1u6D8y-k8arlRarloNdoLz4SFyLE-79neRo&amp;usqp=CAU">by example</a>.
</p>

<p>
Or you can get the idea of quadruple out of a cat. This in
contrast to the case of machine learning where in order to learn
the idea of quadruple you would have to re-index and retrain all
of your data and train again a different algorithm for the
task.. you cannot also ask ML to make a generalization out of a
category as it has no idea on how to do that.
</p>

<p>
Interesting is in this sense to see and think about how we human
are not even conscious ourselves about some structures of our
thinking and decision making. We are black-boxes and this is the
ultimate reason why we need psychologists to remember us such a
thing and tell us that it is okey.
</p>

<p>
However, funny is also the way we cannot accept a black-box
object, pretending that each and every human decision is
motivated by pure rational choices. Note that this tendency is
not just in machine learning but it is pretty much installed in
the human brain of any western person as a core and fundamental
fix-point value. 
</p>

<p>
Well, I see that I am starting to go too much into philosophical
discussion. That is dangerous so I will let it and go back to my
micro-level thinking.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Before_Us">The Life Before Us</a> (Romain Gary):
</p>

<p>
Nice book. I read it in 10 days but I was rather busy. It is the
book from which the movie - la vita davanti a se - originates. See
above your impressions.
</p>

<p>
If the movie made a good impression and was <i>strong</i>; well the
book is at another level. I loved it. The strength of Momo is
powered to the <i>nth</i>. It is the most beautiful thing: the fact
that despite all of the bad things that can happen in life, when a
heart is good, love will win. No compromises, like Momo always
did, very conscious of his misfortune. It is probably that
consciousness that made bearable the unbearable and forged a
character as strong and pure as the one of Momo.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/State-Any-Cost-David-Ben-Gurion/dp/0374112649">A state at any Cost: The Life of David Ben-Gurion</a> (Tom Segev):
</p>

<p>
Well I must say that I agree with the reviews I have read about
the book: not well written.
</p>

<p>
I think that Segev could have been more thoughtful and could
invested more time in organizing his very big research material
and structure a bit more the book. It is way too long, the
language and the way it is written not very engaging. I think that
a common thread is sometimes missing.
</p>

<p>
Despite of all of that, there is interesting things in the
book. First of all the character of Ben-Gurion. What a beautiful
character. Here Segev managed quite well to report the picture of
the battled David character, albeit I think he took some liberty
and biased a little bit the book at times in one direction or the
other.
</p>

<p>
In any case wonderful and charismatic person Ben-Gurion. It is
kind of heart warming reading about the struggles of such a great
person. You see once again that even people that managed great
things in life faced quite some lows and difficulties often
doubting of themselves.
</p>

<p>
Important is to see how in the end no matter how hard he fell -
especially in his youth - he managed to reach his goals. As it is
framed in the book - not be cause he was an outliers or
high-performer individual but rather because he had a very strong
life purpose and was highly committed to it. Make the plan
explicit and the rest will follow. I must admit that in comparison
to Ben-Gurion I do not have a fix-point or north star that reaches
in any level the one of him. I guess because at the end I like to
take pleasure from small things. But I would like to fulfill
myself in some dimension apart from the general family
affection. Will still have to work on that.
</p>

<p>
In any case going back to Ben-Gurion, one thing that I
particularly like is that he was eating books. He had a curious
mind and it was impressive the amount of interest he could
multi-manage and the amount of books he read. I still remember
when I visited his house - which is now a museum in Tel-Aviv. So
many books. Crazy. In this sense you are improving in time. Of
course you are not at the level but there is some Momentum, which
I hope you will improve in time.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, I loved the fact that he was holding a
diary. He was obsessed in organizing his thoughts by putting
things in writing. I love it and I must say that here again I am
improving through this Blog. It is a very good exercise and it
helps as well to organize a bit better my life.
</p>

<p>
And then yeah, what to say. It was good refresher of the history
of Israel and what the land means to the Jewish people. What it
cost and how many troubling moments and decisions where on its
way. In this sense, I must say, there is better literature but it
is fine as that was in fact not the purpose of the book.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Is_a_Man">If this is a Man</a> (Primo Levi):
</p>

<p>
It is a couple of years since I read this book. I read a few
others in the meanwhile but I want to write a few notes on
this. Even if notes are not fresh in my memory, what stroke me the
most of this book was its content.
</p>

<p>
I expected some very hash statement. Some deep philosophical
questions. I expected to find all of that and more in the book. I
was surprised. All of that kind of material is left just in the
title of the book. One sentence: <i>if this is a man</i>. Without
answer nor a question mark.
</p>

<p>
That is the power of the book. It is true to itself. It is the
true, naked message. It is the history of what such people had to
live through in concentration camps.
</p>

<p>
It talks about routine. It talks about how the people that
survived managed the routine; just manage the routine with little
escamotage. That is the daily life of all of us. Manage it at the
microlevel conscious about a bigger picture but without giving it
too much importance.
</p>

<p>
And the book follows that pattern. It does not talk at the
macro-level the complete folly of the Nazis. It talks at the
micro-level of the horrible experience of the people.
</p>

<p>
And it leaves the exercise of making sense of it, if at all
possible, to you with that single title: <i>if this is a man</i>.
