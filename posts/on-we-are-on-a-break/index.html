Gosh. That kicked me. Out of a blue sky. There were issues but I
thought the relation was strong and that everything would be faced in
a mature way. Through discussion, through a fight, through a
commitment. 
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-orgf2e0e77" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf2e0e77">Day 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf2e0e77">
<p>
So story of my life, after 3 years and something of relationship, I
was told these magic 6 words by my girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised. A lot surprised. We have a long distance
relationship. To be honest I do not believe in these break and reflect
stories. It means the story is already over.
</p>

<p>
She told me the 21/02/2021, by phone. Stressing her love. Saying it is
for the best. Saying goodbye amorino at the end. I refused that
sentence. Both at the phone and in myself. That is not how you
act. Really? On the phone.
</p>

<p>
The truth is also that I was pushing her to commit to put the
relationship over the individual work achievements. I will do that in
my life no matter what. So I was ready to do that as of now. She
probably thinks differently. She is very ambitious and that was
probably too much for her.
</p>

<p>
Some say I am a kid and it is not normal to commit to the other over
the job from such a young age. But really? If you don't do it now,
then when? When responsabilties will augment? I do not believe that
kind of narrative. If you follow a line you follow it from the
beginning. Plus we were just discussing on committing on a city. I am
sure that life is complex, and if you adapt, put good effort and you
are good, you will do well no matter what. So I really do not
understand when people act in an opportunistic way. They are probably
just scared and not confident enough in their capabilities. I do not
think that it is the case of her. She is not the type. There might be
some aspect of work relating to this though. Plus in any case I am
convinced that we both did work too much recently.
</p>

<p>
Well, now I do not know if that is what is in her head. In fact,
unfortunately I do not know at all what is in her head. She just told
me at the phone in 5 min. And me, I was too surprised to get this news
and in such a method. I could not start a conversation. A serious one
asking what was wrong. We had met the weekend before. If she wanted to
face things we could have done it then.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, she promised a letter. I guess that there, there will be more
motivations. I will then wait for this and see. In any case I really
think that our relationship is on the ground. I do not see it as a
true possibility to gain it back. Also trust. Yesterday night, in the
first night; I was so tempted to say screw you. It's over; I will not
wait here like a sentenced to death person. If there are issues let's
face them and solve them otherwise let's let each other go, no matter
how difficult that is.
</p>

<p>
I resisted. I controlled myself. I decided to wait until the
letter. Let's see what will come then.
</p>

<p>
In any case the emotion of this first day is the following: <b>anger</b>. I
am happy though that I could control it that far. Did not text her so
far. And committed to wait and give it a try. Let's see how it will
develop in the next couple of days.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgba197bd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgba197bd">Day 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgba197bd">
<p>
I texted her. I could not accept that we are on a break story. Like
this, without any explanation. It was too much.
</p>

<p>
I really think that if there are issues you go and solve them. So I
texted her. I told her that either we would discuss and see what to
do and face it or we would break up 100%.
</p>

<p>
I think it was the right decision. She told me I am right. And she
told me she agreed that she gave to little explanation. Let's see
how it will evolve. She made me understand she is still in love. She
just has this very aggressive strategy of fixing an issue of us. I
do not see as the solution.
</p>

<p>
I really hope we will be able to sort things out.
</p>

<p>
In the last day I started to listen to one music album. I was
listening to it before I did text her. It is so deep. It expresses
well my feelings for her. It is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YAX8wgdQRU">this wonderful album</a>. I decided I
will create a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=milktape">milktape</a> for her birthday and give it to her. I will
include some of the songs I like the most. A bit old fashioned but
it is indeed one of the most romantic things and I guess one of the
nicest presents one can get.
</p>

<p>
I think now the most important thing is to understand how she feels
really. And face her in the right way. She is a very special girl. I
have to be careful with her. She does not speak much openly on what
she has in mind. This entire situation is just a demonstration of
that. Also, her big life hit. She just talked to me about it once in
3 years. After I pushed a bit. She is so precious. But you must make
her understand somehow that it is important to talk more.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org86898e2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org86898e2">Day 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86898e2">
<p>
I am calm now. I do not feel that pressure of the first day
today. I feel normal. Maybe that is wrong. I should call with her
today. Let's see if she will call.
</p>

<p>
I also booked for going to Frankfurt in two weekends. We will see
how it will develop.
</p>

<p>
Finger crossed.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org6b53b9c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6b53b9c">Day 4</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6b53b9c">
<p>
Ok so I did talk to her. Everything looks fine. It was just poor
communication. I told her in any case that we have to improve in
this dimension and that she has to open up a bit more.
</p>

<p>
Meaning that she cannot do like this, i.e. not tell me what she has
in mind for a longer period of time and the suddenly break out with
such a huge thing. It mines trust in one relationship. She told me
it was just this one thing that she kept from me.
</p>

<p>
I told her that it is not good. Cause if she does not tell me that
one thing and keeps it from me, then I cannot act on it. On top of
it once I know it, in such a way, like now, I start to think that
there could be 1000s other things that she is thinking under
cover.
</p>

<p>
And then it gets more difficult to be relaxed and be who you are.
</p>

<p>
This is why information is important.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5bca77e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5bca77e">Day 7</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bca77e">
<p>
I skipped a bit of days. Went skiing for a weekend with friends. It
helped a bit to free up the mind. I talked with her when being
there. Also with the other friends as they are friends in common.
</p>

<p>
I think everything is back to normal now. More less. We will just
have to solve this issue of us and start to talk more openly when
things do not work.
</p>

<p>
I will now stop to make daily updates and will continue with weekly
updates.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0dabb55" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0dabb55">Day 14</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0dabb55">
<p>
So I was in Frankfurt last weekend. It was nice. I slept in an
hotel. We saw each other for dinner. We had a great time
together. There is a great bound between us. I think that this
surprise stressed it even more.
</p>

<p>
We made out a strategy and a plan on how to deal with our issue in
the future. I think everything will be good. Tackling it bit by
bit.
</p>

<p>
However, you should learn your lesson from it. You should not let
it go for too long when there is something you do not like. On the
long run otherwise everything will emerge. As we say in italian:
<i>tutti i nodi vengono a galla</i>. So you have to deal with them at
the right time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddd7340" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgddd7340">Day 21</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgddd7340">
<p>
So we are now in this setting where we do not hear each other. She
asked for it and I accepted at the end of a conversation. From my
point of view is not changing too much. Because of her work we were
not talking too much in either case on a daily basis. But now that
you have to think about it you note it better.
</p>

<p>
I am still in awaiting mode. I should still get a letter from her
and I really hope that she will find the serenity from this
period and that we will start a new white page after it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge20d025" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge20d025">Day 28</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge20d025">
<p>
After two weeks we called. She seems to be good luckily. She is just
working so much that it is crazy. The more time goes by, the more I
think this is the real issue.
</p>

<p>
At the moment there is little I can do to be honest. Just have
patience and give time to the time. We will see at the end of the
day how everything will evolve. I guess that we will have to wait
until September and we have to test together again the living
together. Just at this time we will start to slowly get back to
where we were cause as at the moment it is just to difficult.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0728a17" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0728a17">Day 35</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0728a17">
<p>
Omg. it's already 35 days since it happens. I am tired of this
situation and relation. We really have to see us more often. I have
to wait more than one month to see her I understood. A bit too much
for my taste. My energies are going away. I have to quickly gather
them back.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org3ee54e5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3ee54e5">Day 42</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ee54e5">
<p>
I am tired. I had to pull her ears. I mean I do not know what is
going on with her. She is so unrespectful and she seems not to care
anymore about the relationship. She has to understand that whatever
is going on with her she has to care for the others.
</p>

<p>
I should speak with her today Monday 05.04 as yesterday after 2
weeks without talking as agreed she was sporadically answering or
saying she would call later, which she never did.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd05dff1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd05dff1">Day 49</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd05dff1">
<p>
No update to this stage. I think it will be critical to find job in
the same city. Both of us are checking. Let's see how it will
evolve.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4c2a07c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4c2a07c">Day 56</h2>

Notes skipped

<h2 id="orgb1749db">Day 61</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb1749db">
<p>
Omg.. this girl will drive me crazy. It is crazy the mental state
she lives in. I do not understand how it is possible.
</p>

<p>
This work is driving people crazy. I will wait a bit until she
leaves this horrible job. But then if she is not back to normal that
is too much for me.
</p>

<p>
Totally out such people.
