I recently had to write a documentation on how to leverage the IBM
Data Shield service. This is a very powerful tool to convert any
docker image into SGX-architecture complaint images that can run on
SGX enabled processors.

This is a very powerful tool in order to increase the achievable
security level on public clouds and might foster new business models
on public clouds.

Please refer to the documentation and learn more by following [[https://marcohassan.github.io/Datashield/DataShield_Clen_Documentation][this link]].
