The more I work on this project, the more sure I get. You need a
proper way to document your code structure. To jump into the source
base is otherwise extremly hard for freshies like me. On the top of it
given the amount of packages we need to maintain and expand I highly
doubt that it is efficient to not have such documentation. The time it
costs to go back and understand the general structure of the project,
even for the lead developer of the project is simply to high.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, even a relative fresher into OOP as me, could find
some fundamental holes in the program logic here and there, in the
code base of a project. I must say that the developement of the
project is still ongoing, so I must check with the colleagues if they
are aware of such holes. In any case, I am pretty much sure that parts
of the fundamental holes result by a lack of high-level meta-overview
of the classes and interdependencies. Such holes may easily evolve in
such larger projects, that you touch across longer time horizons
without having the clear structure all of the time in your mind.
</p>

<p>
If you are missing the macro at some point the micro will reign and
the micro is usually nasty. The macro should lead your way of project
understanding. The micro should be just a modular low-level
intervention dictated by the macro.
</p>

<p>
Recall this. And work in such a way, otherwise things will come to
hunt back to you and your peace in future. 
</p>

<p>
In this sense I started quickly to explore for a couple of hours some
UML tools and their integration with the eclipse IDE.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes. I hope that in this sense I will have a proper
workflow in this dimension in the next couple of months.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-orgd72028c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd72028c">Current Situation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd72028c">
<p>
So the current situation is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for new projects you can create your UML class diagrams on the
fly. it will help you to define the structure of your
projects. And even if some round-trip-engineering would be cool
and would save you a bit of time, it is not of first-order
importance.</li>

<li>for the many existing projects, you have to find a tool that
parses the source code to UML class diagrams. Such overview is
fundamental as it will allow you to increase the speed through
which you can make sense of the projects.</li>

<li>QUESTION: once you have the general UML class diagram for an
existing project, how do you expand on it? I.e. you will have to
find a tool that does not take the code-snapshot as an image
data-format but that allows you the expansion on the top of it. I
do not want to re-write such images into some tool where I could
expand on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course the best way to work, would be to have a strong tool with
round trip-engineering. The issue is that to this stage, I could not
find a non-commercial version that easily integrates with
Eclipse. Funny world… the entire world works thorugh these
projects and such gaps still exists in the open-source
communities. After all it is all business.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org409188a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org409188a">UML Lab</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org409188a">
<p>
This is in fact the best and most solid tool that I could find. Look
at <a href="https://www.uml-lab.com/en/uml-lab/videos/round-trip-engineering-ng-video/">this video</a>. That would be exactly what you would aim at.
</p>

<p>
Keep it in the back of your mind. Go and look at the costs at some
later time-point. Maybe at some later time point you can make the
point for it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5f39b8b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5f39b8b">PlantUMl</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f39b8b">
<p>
Ok, this was so far my default go-to tool. You can work well with it
for your green-field projects. It will be cumbersome at some point
to keep an up-to-date documentation, if you work on shared projects
as I highly doubt that other people will onboard on it.
</p>

<p>
Keep it for your stuff.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd64e356" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd64e356">Visual Paradigm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd64e356">
<p>
This is worth to explore at some later time point.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/support/documents/vpuserguide/12/14/6008_windows2000n.html">solid documenation</a>. And it seems that there are quite
some functionalities you can explore.
</p>

<p>
There is also a commercial version for it, so that this points to
the fact that people working at it are probably serious in their
intentions.
</p>

<p>
The issue is that when I installed the portable version of the
software and lunched the program I got some security warning from my
OS and it seems that not too many people work with it.
</p>

<p>
Given the high care there is on security in the financial
institution I work at, I decided to let it be for the time
being. This especially as I am not even sure that this would be the
ultimate panacea.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7505000" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7505000">Eclipse UML Generator</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7505000">
<p>
That would have been it. All of the major features I needed were
mentioned there. The project was just archived. There was no
development since 2015. So again a failed project in this space.
</p>

<p>
Interesting this world. Check at the following todo in this sense.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org174de10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org174de10">
<span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Have to understand how come that such space is so underdeveloped</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org174de10">
<p>
Given the benefit that it can bring I cannot really understand the
situation and the fact that it takes more than two hours to find
a convenient tool to perform such tasks that easily integrates with
different IDEs. 
</p>

<p>
It seems that this is actual the case. The world did not manage to
properly set up a workflow in this dimension as you can easily infer
from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_engineering">wikipedia page</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is fun that people talk then about machine learning and how the
entire world will be robotic. I laugh.
