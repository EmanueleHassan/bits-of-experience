<p>
What Gutman is doing in bringing this young, idealistic group to this
desert ruin is using the Hebrew past ot give depth to the Hebrew
present and to enable it to face the Hebrew future.
</p>

<p>
(When talking about the Israeli pioneers bringing up young people to Masada)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Since November 28 1941, when the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin
al/Husseini, met Adolf Hitler in Berlin, there has been an official
alliance between the Arab-Palestinian movement headed by Husseni and
the Third Reich.
</p>

<p>
So now, in the early winter of 1942, there is growing concern in Tel
Aviv regarding the possible combination of a German invasion of the
land with a pro-Nazi Arab-Palestinian assault.
</p>

<p>
It now appears that the distant past is merging with the present,that
the mythical is coupling with the real.
</p>

<p>
(On a historic fact - an added thing that you have to add to the
psychological factor weighting on the yet to be Israeli of the time)   
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When Herbert Bentwich saw Lydda from the white tower of Ramleh in
APril 1897, he should have seen that if a Jewish state was to exist in
Palestine, an Arab Lydda could not exist at its center.
</p>

<p>
He should have known that Lydda was an obstacle blocking the road to
the Jewish state and that one day Zionism would have to remove it.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
Unlike the brigade commander or Bulldozer or the training group,
Gutman gets it. He is fully aware of the strategic and moral dilemmas
he is faced with. He has always known that his generation's mission
would be to rid the country of its Arabs. And he always known how
terrible it would be to rid the country of its Arabs.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
Tabenkin was perfectly clear. He was not in a position to give
specific orders, but his general instruction to Palmach headquarters
was that war presented a one-time opportunity to solve the Arab
problem. Yigal Allon, too, said that this was the moment. He said they
must not be. Allon was a humanist, but he said that the Arabs must not
remain or else there would not be a state.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
You see the humanist education you received collapsing. And you see
the Jewish soldiers, and you see the marching Arabs, and you feel
heavy, and deeply sad. You feel like you're facing something so
immense you cannot deal with, you cannot even grasp.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
Do I wash my hands of Zionism? Do I turn my back on the Jewish
national movement that carried out the deed of Lydda? Like the brigade
commander, I am faced with something too immense to deal with. Like
the military governor, Gutman, I see a reality I cannot contain. Like
the training group leader, I am not only sad, I am horrified. For
when one opens the black box, one understands that whereas the small
mosque massacre could have been a misunderstanding brought about by
a tragic chain of accidental events, the conquest of Lydda and the
expulsion of Lydda were no accident. They were an inevitable phase of
the Zionist revolution that laid the foundation for the Zionist
state. Lydda is an integral and essential part of our story. And when
I try to be honest about it, I see that the choice is stark: either
reject Zionism because of Lydda, or accept Zionism along Lydda. 
</p>

<p>
The housing estate, <i>shikun</i>, became the defining feature of the
Israeli welfare state.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
There was an artificial quality to everything. Zionism was not an
organic process anymore but a futuristic coup. For its outstanding
economic, soical, and engineering achievements, the new Israel paid a
dear moral price. There was no notion of human rights, civil rights,
due process, or laissez faire. THere was no equality for the
Palestinian minority and no compassion for the Palestinian
refugees. There was little respect for the Jewish Diaspora and little
empathy for the survivors of the Holocaust. Ben Gurion's statism and
monolithic rule compelled the nation forward.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Only as an Israeli could he turn from being an object of history to
beinga a subject of history. Only as an Israeli could he be the master
of his own fate.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
To survive, they [the Israeli] cleanse themselves of the past. To
function, they flatten themselves. They turn into people of action
whose personalities are rigid and deformed, whose souls are
shallow. THey lose the riches of Jewish culture as they are shaped by
a new synthetic culture that lacks tradition and nuance ad irony. They
create a loud, externalized way of life that is eager to display a
forced gaiety. They have lost the place they came from without knowing
where they are heading.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
In every immigrant society, as in every postwar society, the children
are the crux. But in the Bizaron housing estate the children are
everything. Like Leah and Zvi Brik, the thirty- and forty-year old
parents know they are the desert generation. Though they were saved
from annihilation, they know that they will never reach a true
haven. For them everything is temporary, fragile, and in doubt. For
them life is waiting for the next catastrophe. But their children are
something else. For even though the bow was scorched and deformed in
the great fire, it can still soot a future-bound arrow.
</p>

<p>
Because the children's education is the first priority: only what a
person knows cannot be taken away from him. Everything in Bizaron is
done in the name of the children, so that the children will be able to
knock on the gates of the future closed to their parents.

<p>
The mere thought that this tiny, weak nation would succeed in
obtaining nuclear capabilities seemed audacious, megalomaniacal, even
unhinged. And yet the founder of the Jewish state was adamant: Israel
must acquire a nuclear option.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
The war toughened him and hardened his heart. It taught him that he
was resourceful, capable and bold. At the end of the war, the platoon
commander felt that there was no such thing as mission
impossible. There was nothing in the world that could not be
conquered.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
But all of these activities were not coordinated, and they were not
part of a consolidated work plan. THey stemmed from the understanding
of about a dozen people that this age was the nuclear age, and that
Israel must ne at its forefornt; that if Israel feell behind the Arabs
in the nuclear arms race, it would cease to exist.
</p>

<p>

Dimona symbolized the best of Israel of the 1960s: the vision,
imagination, soberness, daring , tenacity, power, restraint, and
resolve. A stern rule of rationality.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
Seemingly opacity is a joke. An agreed-upon convention. Something that
everyone knows but of which no one speaks about. But in truth opacity
is genius. There is something profuondly wise about Israel's desire
not to know about Dimona, to see it only in the grainy photographs
taken from a very great distance with a telephoto lens.
</p>

<p>
To hear news of Dimona only from foreign sources and international
publications. Alongside the decision that Dimona was essential, there
developed in Israel an understanding that Dimona is impossible. ANd in
order to reduce to a minimum the possibility that any use might one
day be made of it, Israel understood that it could in no way rely on
Dimona. Life should be lived as if Dimona does not exists.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
If everyone spent as much time thinking as you do they would have
never act. If everyone had spent as much time thinking, these thoughts
would have paralyzed them and kept them from building Dimona.

<p>
Unbelievable how many geniuses this country has spawned. Unbelievable
what music and literature and poetry this country has created. Here,

nation of talent and joy and endless creativity.

<p>
But now OFra-s illegitimacy taints Israel itself. Like a cancer, it
spreads from one organ to another, endangering the entire body. Ofra's
colonialism makes the world perceive Israel as a colonialist entity.
</p>

<p>
That is why Israel is at odds with itself. Although the founders of
Ofra wished to strengthen Israel, in practice they weakened it. So
when the great war does break out, it will meet an isolated,
ostracized, and divided Israel - an Israel that will hardly be able to
defend itself.

Now the screams grow weaker. They change to sobbing, wailing. Yet I
know that from this moment on nothing will be as it was. A person who
has heard the screams of another is a transformed person.
</p>

<p>
Whether he does something about it or not, he is transformed. And I
have heard the screams of another. I still do. Even as the screaming
men stop screaming, I still hear them screaming. I cannot stop
hearing.

<p>
For in most cases, the evil do not know they are evil. Those who carry
out atrocities don't know they are doing so; they are simply obeying
orders. Or waiting for a promotion. Or doing what they have to do to
get on, when all they really want is to be home, safe and sound. And
they worry about their taxes, and about their kids' problems in
school. But as they are thinking about home and wife and bills to be
paid, their hands unthinkingly hold the weapon; their eyes are on the
fence behind which other people are sobbing.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
This is how it works: The people who vote for Israel's right wing
parties are not evil; they do not round up youngsters in the middle of
the night. And the ministers who represent the right-wing voters in
the government are not evil; they do not hit boys in the stomach with
their own fists. And the army's chief of staff is not evil; he carries
out what a legimate, elected government obliges him to carry out. And
the commander of the internment facility is not evil - he is doing the
best he can under impossible circumstances. And the interrogators -
well, after all, they are doing their job. And it is, they are told,
impossible to govern the occupied territories unless they do all
this. As for the jailers, most of them are not evil, either. They only
want to leave all this behind and get back home.
</p>

<p>
Yet in some mysterious way, all these nonevil people manage together
to produce a result that is evil indeed. And evil is always greater
than the sum of its parts, greater than all who contribute to it and
carry it out. Despite our unkempt exteriors, our clumsiness, our
pathetic petit-bourgeois ways, we are evil in Gaza. But this evil of
ours is a cunning evil. For it is an evil that happens, as it were, of
its own accord, an evil for which the responsibility is no one's. Evil
without evildoers. 
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
This is such a situation. There are no complexities here, no
mitigating circumstances. This is what the Palestinians have brought
upon us by means of uprising: they deprived us of the illusion of
bearable occupation. They have told us that if we are to occupy Gaza,
we must have a Gaza Beach prision. And if we are to have such a
prison, we must betray ourselves. We must betray everything we were to
be and everything we are to be. So the question now is not land for
peace. The question is land for our decency. Land for our
humanity. Land for our very soul.

A human life, I think, should be well rooted in some spot of a native
land, where it may get the love of tender kinship for the face of
earth, for the labours men go forth to, for the sounds and accents
that haunt it, for whatever will give that early home a familiar
unmistakable difference amidst the future widening of knowledge: a
spot where the definiteness of early memories may be inwrought with
affection.

<p>
The Jewish tradition, Bialik essentially says, is a cancer that has
destroyed the Jew's humanity.
</p>

<p>
For Bialik therefore, and for many of his contemporaries, the point of
Zionism, of the return to the Jewish homeland, was not simply to
create a refuge or to fix the "Jewish problem" in Europe. The reason
that Jews needed to return to their land was that it was only there
that the Jews could fashion a "new Jew". It was time, he insisted, to
re-create the Maccabees of old. It was time for the Jewish nation to
be reborn.

<blockquote>
<p>
A much discussed passage of the Babylonian Talmud refers to three
oaths to which Israel and the nations of the world committed
themselves. The nations of the world swore that they would not oppress
the nation of Israel excessively, while Israel swore not to enter the
Land of Israel by force and not to rebel against the nations of the
world. 
[…]
To them, Zionism - which sought to place history and the fate of the
Jews in human hands - was a violation of the essence of Judaism. The
fact that most of the movement's leadership was not only fiercely
secular, but rabidly antireligious, just confirmed their sense. They
railed against the Zionists and would have nothing to do with them. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 3 - A Conversation, Not an Ideology)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The important takeaway is the following, and this is the
quintessential value and backbone of Israel - pluralism.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When Zionists ultimately succeeded in creating a state, however, all
these rival factions would have to live together in what would become
a hastily declared and built country. As much as they disagreed with
one another, they would have to live, love go to battle, build a
country - and die - together. Israel's fractious politics and
turbulent political life are, in many respects, the result of these
early, unresolved Zionist debates. When it eventually arose, the
Jewish state would be one that Jews were struggling to learn how to
share. As the great Hebrew writer and early Zionist Yosef Brenner put
it, Zionism was in some ways "forced to put forth branches before it
[had] time to strike root."

Once Ben-Yehuda and his wife had settled in the Land of Israel in
1881, they spoke only Hebrew to each other and to their children. They
would not permit their children to speak anyone else in any language
other than Hebrew. Since there were, essentially, no other Hebrew
speakers, their children could speak only to their family.
[…]
With time, Ben-Yehuda found partners in the battle. He and a small
group of other Hebrew enthusiasts penned Hebrew literature at an
extraordinary pace.
[…]
It was the classic revolutionary elite versus the rank and file. The
Hebrew writers were determined to create high culture, but the
immigrants were equally desperate to relax, to not work their minds as
hard as they had to work their bodies.

In Yavetz's story, the Diaspora Jew refuses to join the pioneer men,

view since it would mean getting his trousers wet. Unlike the
"Tourist", the "Resident" is earthy and active; he is dressed simply
in Arabic style clothing, holds a weapon for self-defense, and rides a
white horse. He embodies health, confidence, and passion for life. He
is Bialik's new Jew who would not hide behind a cask during a pogrom,
a new Jew who is determined to break with his victimlike past, the new
Jew intent on taking control of his destiny. Now, thanks to Yavetz,
that literary discussion of the new Jew had moved from EU to
Palestine, from exile to budding Yishuv.

Brenner was passionate but complex. In a way that would somehow
characterize the Zionist movement in the decades to come, he was both
deeply dedicated to the movement and, at the same time, an unremitting
pessimist.
Intensely committed to creating a new form of Hebrew culture in
Palestine, he sometimes felt that his ideals notwithstanding, there
was nothing utopian about what the Zionists were building. Exile, he
said, had simply relocated to the Land of Israel.

<p>
A <i>tel</i> is a hill created by the remains of homes and buildings of
many generations of people who had lived and rebuilt communities on
the same location.
With time, the level of the hill rises, creating a mound that can be
excavated layer by layer to discover the various stages of life
there. <i>Tel</i> was a reference to the past. <i>Aviv</i> is the Hebrew word
for "spring". Aviv, therefore, captured the Old-New Land to which
Herzl referred in Altneuland.

[Note about Chaim Arlosoroff]
</p>

<p>
In June 1933, after having risen to the top of the Yishuv-s
leadership, Arlosoroff returned to Germany to negotiate with German
officials. His mission in Germany was to advance a clan called the
Ha'avarah ("Transfer Agreement") that would allow German Jews to leave
Germany without having to forfeit all their assets.
Jews emigrating from Germany would deposit their money in a fund that
was made available to Palestinian banks. Those banks would then
purchase German goods that were shipped to Palestine. In Palestine,
merchants would purchase the goods, and the money from the purchase
would then be returned to the Jews who had emigrated from Germany.
</p>

<p>
Jabotinsky railed against the Transfer Agreement; he thought it was
a foolhardy attempt to undermine Germany's economic isolation.

beach. Out of the dark, two men approached, one shining a flashlight

The political activist (Arlosoroff), the poet (Bialik) and the
philosopher (Ahad Ha'am) lay side by side - a fitting image of
Zionism's deep intellectual roots and many different voices, and also,
of the ability of those many streams to come together at critical
moments.

of destiny - the virtue of their people in a great hour.

<blockquote>
<p>
This book is for them, as much for anybody; a word from their
renowned fallen peer, to reassure them that their hard long training
is needed, that love of the country is noble, that self-sacrifice is
rewarding, that to be ready to fight for freedom fills a man with a
sense of worth like nothing else.

<p>
The trouble with the youth here is that their lives are meager in
content, drifting as though in a dream or a game.

future.

<blockquote>
<p>
The only thing people talk about is cars and girls. Life revolves
around one subject - sex. I think Freud would have found very
fertile soil here. Bit by bit I'm becoming convinced I'm living
among apes and not human beings.

<blockquote>
<p>
I must feel certain that not only at the moment of my death shall I
be able to account for the time I have lived; I ought to be ready at
every moment of my life to confront myself and say - This is what
I've done.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan - High School time when he moved to US)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the striking fact, that such thoughts were written when he was
17 or something like that. You can understand the caliber of the
person by it. I was one of that people at this age. The thing is
that I was scared at this time. I was not really believing 100% in
myself and I was lacking purpose. Make sure that you will not have
your children enter this state of mind.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Life consists of countless experiences and is measured from
innumerable points of view. But the things I did, I did with utter
sincerity, and devoted all my strength to their accomplishment.

<p>
Learning is important above all else. The desire to study and
acquire knowledge, to solve problems, to read and understand - these
are the things that make a man great. At the same time you have to
get along with the society in which you live - with your friends and
most of all with Father and Mother.

It seems that I can stand anything except this state of ignorance,
this dependence on the decisions and utterances of someone else; and
this is precisely the condition in which I now find myself.

<p>
(Jonathan writing his Family on his decision of rejecting the air-force)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Man's strength lies in his ability to adapt himself to new
conditions and to reconcile himself to them. Needless to say,
everything depends on you - on your state of mind, on your successes
and failures both in Zahal and in life in general. Isn't that so?
You have to try to find the positive of the service, in the army as
a whole, and use it to its fullest.

In the army I have learned to appreciate the beauty of life, the

<p>
Perhaps you don't really understand the importance of doing what you

you do understand this, as your actions and your successes indicate,
then how on earth can you belittle your activities in this way?

The below is important as young people often lack the understanding
of what their superiors are doing. This also happens very often in
the office. Often due to some lack of communication.

In the past, when I was just an ordinary soldier, I thought I was
going through the greatest difficulty. Now as an officer, I see how
wrong I was.

(Jonathan to Family - March 15 1966 - Zahal officer training)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I once thought an officer could get more rest than an ordinary
soldier, but I could not have been more wrong. During drills I am
with them through each of all those long hours, and all that time
the work keeps me continually on edge. The burden of worry and
responsibility leaves its mark, and I feel the full weight of
command resting on my shoulders.

<blockquote>
<p>
"Impossible!" This is the slogan of despair to which everyone
clings. And since it's "impossible", they let themselves do
nothing. To hold one's own in such an atmosphere is therefore a
serious challenge.

</p>

<p>
As you know, when I decide to do something, I devote myself
completely to the matter at hand and cannot do anything else, since
I have to do things perfectly. It's not a matter of principle or
calculated decision, it's simply the way I am.

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most interesting phenomena that I observe in the course
of my work is what I call "the gold rush". When a man begins to
earn money, he wants more and more and finds it terribly hard to
disengage himself from what looks like a gold mine.

really felt I could match myself against them. I do all that is
required of me completely and to the best of my ability, but when
I've finished doing it's over and done with.

Now that I am in Israel, I realize how much I missed that part of
myself whose origin and place is in Israel. When I was in America, I
missed it and I knew that my place was here, but not until I got
back did I know how right I was.

<blockquote>
<p>
Only if we do that, if we give all we have for the well-being of our
country, will Israel remain the State of the Jews. Only then will
they not write in the history books that once indeed the Jews roused
themselves to action and held on to their land for two decades, but
then were overwhelmed and became once more homeless wanderers.
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Father when moving to Boston to study at Harvard - July
22, 1968)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
On me, on us, the young men of Israel, rests the duty of keeping our
country safe. This is a heavy responsibility, which matures us
early. It seems that the young Israeli belongs to a special breed of
men. It's hard to explain this, but it can be felt. 
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
What unites them produces a feeling of brotherhood, of mutual
responsibility, a recognition of the value of man and his life, a
strong and sincere desire for peace, a readiness to stand in the
breach, and much more.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
As regards the latest incidents, I really must praise the Jewish
people of Israel. The cool-headedness, the lack of hysteria, the
immediate control of every situation, are really surprising. You
don't find here the raging mob quality that is rather typical of
hard times. This is a special people and it is good to belong to
it.

deal.

<p>
I believe that in every generation people fall back on the
past. It's not because the past was more peaceful, more serene, but
because time glasses, so that everything looks rosy and doesn't hurt
the eyes.

(Jonathan to Bruria - when slowly falling in love again after the
harsh experience with Tutti - November 11, 1974)
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>
Anyone who believes there is another purpose is welcome to it - the
main thing is not to live aimlessly. Those who have nothing to hold
on to are always discontented, always find idols for themselves and
always abandon them for new ones. They are lucky in having an idol
when they do, and unlucky in not "having long-term satisfaction" -
something that idols cannot provide. 
</p>

<p>
(Jonathan to Bruria - when slowly falling in love again after the
 harsh experience with Tutti - November 11, 1974)

<blockquote>
<p>
And you know as well as I do that there can be good days and bad,
full or empty, and the only thing that can change our momentary
state of mind is our <i>general</i> state of mind, which guides us
through life. 
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
Enthusiasm and imagination soaring to the skies are gods of youth,
and I want to believe that in you they are eternal. I want to
believe it, first, because youth becomes you; second, because if you
should ever lose them, your sense of loss will be unbearable, and I,
who love you so, will grieve with you.
</p>

<p>
[…]
</p>

<p>
I don't regret the crossroads I've passed. Once past the crossing,
I'm on my own way. And if there is more beauty, more flowers along
the road I didn't take, I still don't regret it, because it wasn't
my road. My path will pass through fertile fields and lovely
gardens, and over mountains and rocks and even deserts, but in all
its twists it will be one path - known and yet mysterious. Our life
is a world unto itself within many others. -
for the roads are numberless. Some intersect while others pass
through planes that will never touch. And all the roads are traveled
by people, and sometimes they meet at the crossroads, and sometimes
continue together, and sometimes part again and sometimes not. And
it isn't just a matter of direction but of time as well. And why be
so interested in other planes when we can hardly master our own?

<blockquote>
<p>
Dopo aver mostrato che l’uomo può costruire una casa, una città, ci
mostra che può aver bisogno di cercare la pace in campagna, dove la
pace esiste perché usciamo dal mondo che noi stessi abbiamo costruito:
un mondo fatto di case, di chiese e di piazze; un mondo costruito
dall’uomo e costruito” perchè non ci si vive più così per vivere, come
le piante, senza saper di vivere; bensì per qualche cosa che non c’è e
che vi mettiamo noi; per qualche cosa che dia senso e valore alla
vita; un senso, un valore che qua, almeno in parte, riuscite a
perdere, o di cui riconoscete l’affliggente vanità.” Moscarda sembra
desiderare di non aver più coscienza d’esser, come una pietra, come
una pianta!  L’uomo sa come si forma una nuvola che ignora la sua
esistenza ed è sola; ma sa l’uomo spiegare il perchè dei perchè?
Moscarda ricorda la fatica dell’ uomo; la sua pochezza di fronte
l’infinito; ricorda la vanità dei nostri affanni e mostra il contrasto
tra il volo di un semplice uccellino, che vola con ” un frullo e un
trillo” e quello dell’uomo che si alza da terra con un ” motore
strepitoso e puzzolente e la morte avanti.” Il nostro protagonista
alza la sua invettiva contro il mondo finto e meccanico” un altro
mondo nel mondo” , un mondo che ha senso e valore soltanto per l’uomo
che ne è l’artefice: Pirandello ci indica che la caduta dei valori del
suo tempo può portare alla pazzia; può portare al vaneggiare di
Moscarda che immagina di rientrare dalla campagna, camminando lungo il
Corso di Porta Vecchia, dove gli alberi, ” probabilmente”, non pensano
e le bestie non ragionano. Se potessero pensare… Chissà cosa
penserebbero degli uomini che, per godere della loro ombra, li
piantano in città. Forse… Che cosa stavano a fare lì, in mezzo a tanta
gente affaccendata! Orecchie non ne hanno, ma, forse, per crescere
hanno bisogno di silenzio, quel silenzio che c’è nella Piazzetta
dell’Olivelli, ove la terra ogni anno ne approfitta, perché crede che
lì non ci sia la città e che gli uomini se ne siano andati. Quindi,
l’erba cresce, ma per poco perchè lì, invece, è ancora città per cui
giungono gli spazzini a tagliarla, con grande meraviglia degli
uccellini che si chiedono la ragione della presenza di quegli spazzini
e scappano; non lo possono fare, invece, le bestie che tirano il carro
e, forse, tutte le creature, diverse dall’uomo, hanno un senso per sè
che l’uomo non può intendere: ci sarebbe bisogno di una maggiore
intesa tra l’ uomo e le altre creature che sembra si divertano a
mandare all’aria tutte le costruzioni umane con cicloni e
terremoti. Tuttavia, l’uomo ricostruisce, obbedendo a qualcosa,” che
non si sa cosa sia”, e trasforma la materia a modo suo, considerando
materia anche se stesso: perciò si ricostruisce come ricostruisce la
casa ed ognuno si ricostruisce in una forma che gli altri non gli
riconoscono, come ciascuno di noi non riconosce la forma con cui si
ricostruiscono gli altri; ” e la stessa cosa non è uguale per tuttie
anche per ciascuno di noi che può di continuo cangiare, e difatti
cangia di continuo e l’unica realtà è la forma momentanea che
riusciamo a dare a noi stessi, agli altri e alle cose:”la realtà di
tutti diventa quella che gli altri ci danno, ma si tratta di una
realtà valida per gli altri, non per noi: e ciò varrebbe per
tutti. Gli uomini si costruiscono come costruiscono le case, finché
dura la nostra volontà e i nostri sentimenti; quando volontà e
sentimenti vengono a mancare, ci accorgiamo delle nostre illusioni.
