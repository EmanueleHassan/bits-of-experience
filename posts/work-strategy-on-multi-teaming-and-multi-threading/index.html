Ok, so this is a post in line with the previous ones. You are starting
to understand your responsibilities and how the team operates.
</p>

<p>
It is going to be a fun ride. Let's see how it will go in the long
run.
</p>

<p>
Here are some notes that will be your northern star in your new
adventure. They should always be fresh in your mind as they will help
you to keep the right amount of serenity at work and to work in the
best possible way given your limited amount of time and mental
resources.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-org461915b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org461915b">Situation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org461915b">
<p>
So you are not really multi-teaming, you are sitting in a very well
specified team within Group Investment Management. Still you are for
sure multi-threading, as the amount of people in the team is very
limited you have to deal with multiple highly engaging topics, where
deep expertise is required.
</p>

<p>
So far I distinctly recognized the following topics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an IT landscape that is far from trivial. It grew large in the
last decades. There is quite some legacy technology involved,
there is no clear cut of responsibilities as in larger IT
companies. You have no architects, developers, testers and
operations distinction. You have to take over multiple
responsibilities and wear multiple hats. This multi-task alone
would be sufficient for a single person to deal with.</li>

<li>a business environment that is very rooted and geographically
distributed and consequently not trivial to understand. After all
it is a machine encompassing hundreds of professional and you can
imagine that an overview of it is not a trivial task. Still if you
want to become <b>relevant</b> on the long-run you can not limit
yourself to your technical island. You have to properly understand
how the business operates, what the pain points are and who uses
your system across the group investment management value chain.</li>

<li>a market risk system that eventually has a non-trivial
mathematical and development component. This is not the same
pain-point as the first item of this list. I intend the first item
more in the general landscape sense. There the focus lies in the
interconnections among the different components of the system and
how to properly mange them. In contrast I intend this item more at
the low level implementation and understanding of the simulation
engine necessary to operate the risk system. There you need to
master the hadoop stack and the concepts of distributed computing
as well as to keep your mindset mathematically affine.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So how do you mange the situation?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1513ffa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1513ffa">Managing the Situation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1513ffa">
<p>
I think that <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/how-to-stay-focused-if-youre-assigned-to-multiple-projects-at-once">this post</a> of harvard business review reasons well with
what I am feeling right now.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For many people, getting pulled across several different projects is
stressful and less productive than theory would suggest.
</p>

<p>
Switching attention between tasks takes time and saps your focus and
energy.
</p>


<p>
Multiple switches change not only your level of accountability but
also your ability to juggle resources when a crunch time
hits. Different components encompass their own unique cultures, including
relationships, routines, symbols, jokes, expectations, and tolerance
for ambiguity, which requires energy to handle.
</p>

<p>
And unless you carefully plan and negotiate your contribution on each
component, you may end up doing repetitive work instead of pushing
your own development.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The authors suggest then the following working approach to tackle
the situation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
<b>get the big picture:</b> Focusing narrowly on a given day’s work puts
you in a reactive, firefighting mode. Schedule a regular status
check on all your projects to note milestones.
</p>

<p>
This relates to my second item of the above list. So do not forget
about it and schedule periodical time to think about it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Sequence strategically:</b> Pick one task and focus on it intensely,
rather than juggling. Start with the task that requires the greatest
concentration and give it your undivided attention. Decide on a
distinct set of must-achieve outcomes.
</p>

<p>
So basically this is the strategy I decided from the onset of the
work by rotating across the three different points above. Keep it
running but also keep the intervals in your calendar and do not
stick simply to a single task, in order not to loose on the first
point - the big picture. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>protect yourself:</b> in terms - let your stakeholders know you are
aware of them and their needs but buy you the needed margin in order
to work properly.</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>document and communicate progress:</b> Seeing momentum helps your team
leaders feel empowered and in control. Be up front when problems
arise. The earlier you say, “I’ve got a conflict and might have
trouble delivering 100%,” the more leaders will trust you. One
seasoned team member in our research said many of his responses to
team requests are simply two words: “On it.” Even this super-brief
response tells colleagues that he received their request, so they
know he’ll follow up when he can provide more details.
</p>

<p>
I think this is a very
important item and this blog and the non-public created
documentation you can share with the team will help you to reach
this goal.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Know thyself:</b> Under time pressure, the temptation is for each
person to contribute where they already have deep knowledge, rather
than investing in members’ learning and growth. You need to own your
development goals and your progress toward them. Figure out who else
on the team you want exposure to. Make your development goals
explicit, to both your team leader and those experts.
</p>

<p>
<b>very very important</b>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Force thyself:</b> After identifying your development goals, block out
time for actual learning. Research shows that a critical determinant
of learning is time spent reflecting on and integrating new
information. Obviously, you can’t go overboard and become a
bottleneck just to carve out contemplation time, but make sure team
members see reflection as “real work.”
</p>

<p>
Also very important. There you have to be especially
good. Especially in a dynamic team as this you have to show the
value of such reflection periods and documentation items. I believe
in it but you have to show it. The documentation and communication
of progress of the above item might help in this sense.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
