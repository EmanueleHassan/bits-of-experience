This is another of these topics that I always study and forget. 

But it is quite basics stuff and it pops up continuously so it is
better for you to get to know it properly and well fix it into your
brain.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

** The Circle

   Is everywhere. It is the origin of pi as well as the way you tackle
   trigonometry and as well the way you can think of phi.

   It is beautiful, smooth and female in nature. 

   Always keep the circle in mind when approaching things. 

   Recall the properties of the circle:

   #+end_export

   Recall what that essentially mean.

   A square represented by the radius fits around 3.14... times the
   circle.

   The diameter of the circle fits around 6.28... the circumference of
   the circle.

** The unit circle

   Now consider the unit circle. 

   This has 3.14... area and 2*3.14... circumfernece. Interesting
   property. Logically counter-intuitive. I guess this is the reason
   why so many people struggle with math. At times, it looks as if
   mathematicians are fooling around you. 

   In order to understand how the two measure relate you can do the
   following:

   #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-14 142911.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   Which makes logical sense as it is the way of going from circle to
   square. If you think a moment about the integration ranges.

   But then you go:

   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-14 143142.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   Such counter-intuitive things are everywhere when you start to
   think too much. I discovered in time the beauty of them and to
   laugh at them and at yourself when you think too much.

   In any case this is interesting. The circle and the square. That
   duality that you have to deeply explore as you learned from the
   book. 

   Anyways, you see that pi is everywhere here. Isn't it beautiful?

   We will now explore trigonometric functions of the angle at the
   unit circle. 

   Trigonometric functions are *real functions* which relate an angle
   of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. 

   In the specific given an angle you compute the ratios of the length
   of two sides.

   In the specific:

   #+begin_export html
   <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-14 121918.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   So you see that the tan is simply =sin/cos=. 

** Sin and Cos

   You already defined the thing above.

   Understand now that by taking the unit circle as a case (you can
   generalize this to any circle given the fact that the circle
   properties are shared across the circle class) - you can easily
   see:

   If you work with the right triangle in the unit circle it will be
   easy to image values of the sin and cos functions.

    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2023-06-14 133606.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   You can then easily see that the entire pattern is defined within
   the angle described by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian][radian]] 0 - 2pi. 

   It is then easy to see the basic values at optima points 0, pi/2,
   3/2 pi, 2 pi.

   Just recall then the following property: ~f' (sin) = cos~ and ~f'
   (cos) = -sin~.
