So writing a quick notes about this as I see a lot of confusion in my
broader team around this topic and want to make sense in this space
and create a bit of order.

So basically the topic is around /full revaluation methods vs. factor
based methods/. This was a bit the topic of the talk of the morning.

/Update:/ wow it works well the thing of checking where the pain
points are and exploring. Many questions suddenly open up. Many things
to verify and in general a better feeling of the thing. Time to take
off now. It's Tel-aviv time tomorrow.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

I mean I will get to a full appreciation of the topic in a couple of
years as there are so many things to be done here that I still did not
properly got the time to read into the full methodology of the market
risk. But got quite a sense into it by now in the sense that I can
start to put things in perspective at high level.

** Different Valuation Options

   Some of this notes are still based on a bit of guessing. This is what
   you have to do when you work in this stand-alone way.

   Paper used for guessing and inferring: [[https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/12592/1/PubsAmmann2001VaRFMPM.pdf][this]]. By the good old
   Ammann. Should give you quite an overview. 

   So basically start by understanding all of the different ways you
   have for computing the VaR - good to have an overview here in order
   to make mental order:

   The essential idea that leads to such a fragmented space is the
   following:

   Now note that in order to overcome such issues and having to go
   into computational heavy non-parameteric models there is the option
   as well to make approximation - such as the delta or delta-gamma -
   to get ultimately a linear function and compute your risk in a
   handy way.

   So basically if you understand now the different options in this
   dimension you can understand how to set up the entire system
   properly. Cause I understood that most of our portfolio is actually
   based on very simple instruments meaning very easy linear stuff.

   So it makes little sense to model everything via
   full-revaluation. That is wasted computational energy for the world
   and wasted waiting time for the team in general.
   
*** On the Delta-Factor Model VaR

    Ok so that is actually as well interesting and develops a bit on
    the top of the above.

    When reading the internal methodology paper it is like the guy
    wanted to show off the biggest math arsenal available.

    The paper could be written much more in a simplified way at high
    level or at least there could have been a little bit more the high
    level intuition.

    This instead of going big on the little details such as the Ito's
    lemma derivation of the fixed income factor exposures.

    But maybe the point is that the high level stuff is so obvious
    that they skipped it all-together in order for the regulator to
    just get the juicy parts. Well not so sure. I am in general always
    inclined to high level and would just go into lower level stuff if
    forced to.

    In any case what you actually do over there is to find all of the
    different mathematical derivations in order to approximate to
    express the risks as functions of changes in the underlying
    factors, which are then often normal distributed such that you
    would actually ultimately be in the delta-normal risk factor world
    and such that you could actually compute the risk in a parametric
    way.

    So what you are actually reading there is nothing else than
    delta-normal VaR models with complex derivations of the
    delta-factors.

    I mean still have to double check as I go along and get more of a
    full spectrum idea of what is going on there but at the moment
    what I read is like this.

    There is still as well a short circuit I have to surpass cause
    actually you set the option full-revaluation method or not before
    doing the post-processing simulation - the in house defined
    stuff. So basically this is likely dependent just on the
    portfolios you upload and here the choice should be in this regard
    and not across the entire risk generation value chain. So
    everything depends about how we pass these portfolios.

    This is a thing I still have to dig into and understand but if it
    is how I think it is, well then not sure full revaluation is needed.

*** Actually pricing the changes

    So basically given the above you understand that you could
    actually use the parametric model in order to compute your risk.

    We do everything with full revaluation. Why? Understand this. --
    see point above, same question. 

    In any case full revaluation is then the concept of generating a
    new portfolio value for each price path.

    In contrast to it if you use delta-approximations the concept is
    that what you actually do is to leverage greek letters or in
    geneal taylor approximations in order to have your risk function.

    In such a way you could compute the change in the portfolio value
    in an easier way as that component would simply enter the relation
    in a linear way such that per risk factor change you would not
    have to reprice everything but you could enter the thing in the
    formula and get its contribution in a simple way as the relation
    is linear.

** TODO OUTDATED - decide how you want to incorporate it properly

*** TODO understand if riskmetrics = VaR or what

    Not that clear the point above from the literature I could find to
    this stage. 

    Interesting is to read about the [[https://www.value-at-risk.net/riskmetrics/][RiskMetrics history]] as well and
    how it came to be. Now you are in the industry. 40 years ahead more
    less. Sky is the limit - always - cause you point to 100 and you
    will get 30 if you know what I mean :). 

    So basically as mentioned a couple of time we go with the RiskMetrics
    JP Morgan model that the entire industry is using. When you have time
    it will be worth starting digging into [[https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5915b101-4206-4ba0-aee2-3449d5c7e95a][this one as well]] - this will
    give you a more solid understanding of it and you will be able to
    start drawing bechmarks to what you have in place here.

*** TODO understand the story of the full revaluation method
