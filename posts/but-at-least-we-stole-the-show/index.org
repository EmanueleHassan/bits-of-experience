So I am still making sense of all that happened since October 2023.

You made mistakes - and that is okey. You are human after all. 

But now you have to look at them and learn from them. 

{{{TEASER_END}}}

** On Attention

   So by know it should be clear to you that on the one hand you do
   not cope well with the spotlight. You have learnt that too much
   attention is a burden rather than a gift.

   On the other hand, you have learnt that you often attract
   attention. 

   So for now it is enough to hope to live a normal life in the shadow
   of the general attention.

   However, you should be aware of the mechanism that took place in
   the past months and how you reacted to them.

   For instance at the supermarket:

   #+end_export

   Having attention and eyes on you has as well another import
   syntom. It creates expectation that you might feel obliged to
   fulfill.

   But most of all it creates pride. This could be both in the
   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNAGdH5JGOw][positive sense]], as well as in the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SMOyaEXwg][negative one]].

   So how do you counteract such strong tendencies and influences?

** On Mildness

   The secret lies in mildness.

   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2024-02-22 182225.png" class="center">
   #+end_export

   What does that mean?

   Let us dive in the etymology of the [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/mildness][word]].

   Old English milde, of persons, powers, or dispositions, "possessing
   softness or gentleness, good-tempered, merciful,".

   Of weather, "not rough or stormy," late 14c. Of medicine, etc.,
   "gentle or moderate in force, operation, or effect,"
   
   I especially like the part related to the weather: "not rough or
   stormy". Your character should be like this. No matter what happens
   around you - you should stick to the fundamentals and be mild and
   gentle. You have to learn to isolate yourself from what is
   happening around and let the expectations to the other. It is your
   life after all - you have free will and you should not let other
   people behaviour or expectations affect you.

   This is a very important lesson and the sooner you interiorize it,
   the better it will be. You will then be able to live in a balanced
   and gentle way.

   You are learning music now and that is a great gift. As in music,
   when tension rises there is always the option to go back to the
   harmonic center of the piece and resolve the tension in a peaceful
   and beatiful way. Learn from it. There is [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00332925.2018.1536585][dinergy]] in life. Tension
   will always arise but you should have clear in your mind the center
   piece of your being. The harmonic center you can always go back to
   in order to resolve the tension. You should be [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezZdbzreNcs][well tempered]] in
   life after all. 

   So this is what you should do. Keep these adjective close to your
   heart and learn the art of being slow to anger as The Book teaches
   you.
