Here are some notes about how to set up a project.
</p>

<p>
I will use this strucuture in the following projects I will have to
do.
</p>

<p>
For the last project I set up the project from scratch and I think
that I finally found my way to structure Python Projects in the right
way.
</p>

<p>
Right way - this means - a way that satisfies the following properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is modular. This is extremely important. If you manage to work in
a modular way by clearly separating logical structures you might use
some of these structures for further projects you will work on.</li>

<li>It is portable - by the very same argument explained above.</li>

<li>It is minimal - no double effort</li>

<li>It has strong logic - i.e. it is clear what modules and sub-modules
represent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will go into structure and some examples of how to reach such
components next.
</p>

<p>
Note again that this is my second larger project where starting from a
green field I could set everything up. You might want to change and
expand on this structure in following projects.
</p>

<p>
Please, do so and do not forget to expand on that.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Update 04/04/2022</b>: so I started working on more serious projects. I
noted the importance of sticking to standards. I note that this post
does not comply to any standard. It came out of my particular way of
working. That is fine but before going big on this structure you
should probably rather make a more thorough research on existing
standards and possibly migrate this structure to it. In such a way it
will be easier for external people to understand what you are doing
without too much investigation.
</p>

<p>
Despite of this, good to write such posts. Will help in a couple of
years your new team-mates to enter the work you have done.
</p>

<p>
So it is a good time for starting a new post soon that will be the
synthesis of your experience that far. (As I am not doing it right now
as I have to keep the things moving, I store here some links:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/193161/what-is-the-best-project-structure-for-a-python-application">project<sub>structure</sub></a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py">setup<sub>file</sub></a>). It is as well time to start writing
<a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/python-makefile/">Makefiles</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then you can simply pass this and execute this in Docker &amp; Co. and
other similar operations platforms.

So recently I had to do quite some big refactoring and merging for
some code base.
</p>

<p>
I knew about emacs <code>ediffing</code> packages that I used already a couple
of times in the past. It is just a little bit confusing at the
beginning as it is often the case with emacs, you might well be
overwhelmed at the beginning. Too many nice features and you might
quickly get lost in it.
</p>

<p>
The below video should give you a quick introduction to ediffing in
emacs. It is just a very basic tutorial. Then to get more detailed
information you should check at the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html">official documentation</a> (at the
quick help commands section) telling you about all of the different
commands that are quite a few.

So again this is nothing but a quick lesson to keep this big
understanding of the IT systems landscape. That is once more not my
bread and butter. At least so far so also look around as you might
find better sources explaining such content.
</p>

<p>
I am starting to cumulate quite some experience in flask. Ultimately I
had to do quite some project on the backend side for a project.
</p>

<p>
The point came when I had to secure the a webapp I am working
on. As it is an experimental project with low budget I have to perform
multiple tasks. I.e. I developed the data solution and data model. I
implemented the database and have now to make it speak with the
front-end component. 
</p>

<p>
There is an important difference to understand in the way you can
operate with flask and depending on the application type you should
use the one or the other method for securing your application.
</p>

<p>
This is directly related to the <a href="https://build.vsupalov.com/how-backend-and-frontend-communicate/">different types of web-architectures</a>
you can use to structure your front-end. I will briefly go over these
next. It will make you to make sense of everything.

One especially interesting feature that I already used before; but
unfortunately I did not make notes for, is the possibility of
specifying particular functions via the PySpark raw API and make them
available throughout your spark session when working via data-frames -
be it via SparkSQL or via pandas.
</p>

<p>
Note that this notes are based on <a href="https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/content/spark-sql-udfs.html">this source</a>. Looks like a very
exhaustive source. So check at it again should this project really
start. There you might make sense of all of that.

Recently I have downloaded a chart. I will have to change the
configurations of this.

I will have to configure static IP for the internal application
running in kubernetes such that my service will be externally

<p>
Here some notes based on that and some commands.

This entry contains some notes about setting up a CI pipeline. I will
explore especially the <code>Jenkins</code> option and I will integrate it with
Python.
</p>

<p>
After setting up the architecture for a project it is important now to
set up such processes such that we will work with the proper tooling
and will not loose too much time integrating versions over time.

Ok, it turns out I will have also quickly to dig into RDFs its syntax
and concepts.
</p>

<p>
To be honest after I digged deeper into label-property graphs I do not
really see the point of using RDFs graphs and query such graphs via
SPARQL. I did not even start seriously with it and I already have
headache because of the complexity involved. In every little thing in
CS there are layers and layers of complexity and at least 10 ways to
do one thing. That does not help. w3c or whatever should improve on
this, cause it is not fun like this. 
</p>

<p>
In any case, after this quick rant, the point of learning this is that
RDF is useful in itself cause on top of allowing the construction of
RDF graphs and the query via SPARQL it is a w3c standard to store
triples in itself.
</p>

<p>
Standardizations are always good, and this is why such data syntax is
very much used across the world for a smooth data transfer. I.e. even
if you do not like the graph storage and query of such RDF data, it is
useful itself cause its large community endowment.
</p>

<p>
This is why for the solution we will leverage existing RDF ontologies
as well as create our own data store following RDF standards and a
particular RDF ontology format used in Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
At the lower data layer we will therefore work with these. The app
logic, store and retrieve will likely not be through RDFs graphs and SPARQL.

This is just another quick note for myself. I also set it in my
org-agenda as a reminder. I believe in this piece of advice.

<p>
This morning I was doing some research exploring the data science
consulting vs. in house data science world and what people usually
say in merit.

<p>
One reddit leads to the other and at the end I quickly was off
track. I ended up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mc77r3/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_pursue_your_own/">this thread</a>.
