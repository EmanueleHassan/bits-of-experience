Tired of reading my work related stuff? Wanna get to know me
better? This page is for you. After all we human come as a package,
you don't get just the work related skills you also get the character of
the person. 

Mine has a couple of tons of limitations that I constantly work on,
some traits that some will appreciate and some will question and some
traits that are working under cover and are not known to me in
person - looking forward to get to know them.

So here my Photo Blog. Let me open up a little bit; not too much! For
this we have to become /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship][friends]]/. One Photo per month such that it
will hold its value and will stay there as an album in time.

   My first flat on my own - hard work pays off. Have to make it

   It's a matter of style and always recall the [[https://www.fengshuilondon.net/feng-shui-books-reviews/we-shape-our-buildings-thereafter-they-shape-us-winston-churchills-thinking-and-meaning-behind-it][good old Churchill]]:

   My Italian summer. Was good to see long-lasting friends. They
   cheered me up and helped me to get the energies for the next
   reboot.
   
   I was thinking that it is a dozen years by now that we meet at
   the sea. Nice to see that friendship is just augmenting year after year
   despite the fact that we see us so little during the year.

** July

   A break home. The sacro monte. The place my mum loves and the one
