Hi you, 

<br>
<br>

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

<br>
<br>

I am a young professional ready to start a career in a technological
savvy organization that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

<br>
<br>

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I decided
to abandon the idea to start a career in the field and to deviate from 
the most logical career path given my education. 

<br>
<br>

I grow up the belief that sound engineering practices make the difference 
in the real and the data world and decided therefore to go down that road. 

<br>
<br>

Therefore, keeping the best of my educational background, I switched
my focus towards digital processes engineering and the fast developing
data-driven industries with the hope now of making soon part of an
ambitious group working towards turning revolutionary ideas into
practice for the benefit of the community as a whole.

** Working Experience :noexport:

- *IBM*    /Junior Software Engineer Sep 2019 -/

  Part time working student at IBM.

  ◦ Understood that no matter how fast you run, you will always lag
    behind. IT is fascinating and broad, too broad for a single person.

  ◦ Assisting the IBM Global Markets Architects Swiss team.

  ◦ Developing working knowledge of some Opensource technologies as
    well as experiencing the IBM cloud palette

  ◦ As part of the Architect team was exposed to continuous education
    that lets me appreciate and understand the merits and drawbacks of
    key computing/data/development/distribution architectures such as
    serverless architectures, microservices, software containerization,
    hardware virtualization, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, distributed ledger
    technology, data warehouses and data lakes. So basically got a
    high level cover of the modern cloud native architectures.

  ◦ Worked on a 4 month NLP PoC for a client in the public
    sector. Created a customized NLP model and deployed it on a
    web-server through the flask framework. 

    Understood how in real world scenarios you might well have to
    reason about the information architecture and to reason on how to
    improve that to suit the analytics component or, alternatively, how to
    adapt the ML model to the information architecture. It is not simply
    to find and apply the most elegant and theoretical compelling ML
    model.

    Understood the importance of facing clients in an appropriate
    way. Do some training in this sense. Facing the client in the right
    way is key to successful projects.

  ◦ Worked on a R&D project in the healthcare sector.

  ◦ Worked on a data engineering project in the public sector.

  ◦ Speaker at Pydata Zurich - An introduction to Image Recognition and CNN leveraging transfer learning and Data Augmentation.

  ◦ Assisted and participated at various Hackathons.

- *Expedia Group*    /Data Analyst Intern Jun 2019 - Aug 2019/

  Data analyst working as a Member of the Expedia Partner Solutions Analytics Team analyzing the recent developments in the B2B enterprise and templates solutions.

  ◦ Automated Monthly Performance Overview Releases through the creation of ad-hoc Tableau Dashboards.

  ◦ Developed SQL queries to answer Stakeholder Specific Questions.

  ◦ Python seasonality modeling of GBV by Point of Sale. Times series modeling and forecasting of Account Receivables.

  ◦ Tracking of web traffic during partner transition to the progressive web application framework.

- *N-Frnds*    /Jun 2018 - Aug 2018/

  Business intern development for the cloud FinTech company offering banking services in rural areas where traditional business fails to arrive.

  ◦ Identified strategies to further penetrate and expand the 15 Mio. client basis in the Sub-Saharan market.

  ◦ Researched potential partnerships to realize synergies from 21 cloud SaaS patents of the company.

- *Overseas Trade Company*    /Student Assistant Jun 2015 - Jun 2018/

   Part-time assistant at the Sino-Italian gadget import-export family business.

** Education :noexport:

- *Ongoing*

  [[https://www.youracclaim.com/users/marco-hassan/badges][My Acclaim Badges]]

- *Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich*   /Master of Science in Statistics Sep 2019 -/

  1st Semester: Mainly focused on Mathematical Statistics and Bayesian Statistics.

  2nd Semester: Mainly focused on CS at the high level. Big Data and
                Networking classes.

  3rd Semester: Mainly focused on Stochastic Simulation and
                Distributed Systems Algorithms (Consensus, Byzantine
                Agreement, Blockchain)


- *University Of St. Gallen*   
  /Master of Arts in Banking and Finance Sep 2017 -2019/

  Focused on Quantitative Finance: Risk Modeling, Volatility Modeling and EVT.

- *Tel-Aviv University*    /Exchange Semester Oct 2018 - Feb 2019/

  Member of MBA class of 2018. Attended various management related courses.

  Completed courses on /Numerical Analysis/ and /Python Programming/
  offered by the electrical engineering department as own initiative.

  Completed the courses /Consciousness and the Electronic Mind/ and a
  course on /Posthumanism ../ - do not recall exactly the name... was
  centered about how we tend to read the world in an antropomorphic
  way and how we delegate to monstruosity what we human do not like
  and cannot put into this antropomorphic frame - offered by the
  liberal arts department as own initiative.  At the time I did not
  understand how much I could benefit from it and it was challenging
  courses requiring a lot of reading so I thought it was a quite big
  waste of energy. By now I smile when looking back at the times. It
  teaches a lot especially once when working you are not *explicitly*
  relating to humanities.

  Why /explicitly/? Just a fool cannot understand that humanism is at
  the very center of our world in every dimension. Even on how science
  itself is interpreted and carried out.

- *University of Zurich*    /Bachelor of Arts in Business and Economics Sep 2014 - Jun 2017/

  Focused on Macroeconomics and on obtaining a fertile mathematical
  and statistical humus. 

- *Scuola Svizzera di Milano*    /Swiss Matura Sep 2010 - Jun 2014/

  Gained a strong basis in EU most widely spoken languages (German, English, French, Italian) and fully enjoyed spending afternoons with friends.
