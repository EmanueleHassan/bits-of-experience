Hi you, 

I'm happy to see that you landed on my website. 

I am a young professional ready to start a career in a technological
savvy organization that is ready to navigate the next decades through
the power of innovation and revolutionary ideas.

My education started in the field of economics and finance; despite
the mathematical elegance of the academic subjects I recently decided
to abandon the idea to work in such fields due to the lack of project
oriented end-to-end work and the lack of a final product and creation.

Keeping the best of my educational background I am now ready to shift
my focus towards digital processes engineering and the fast developing
data-driven industries with the hope of making soon part of an
ambitious group working towards turning revolutionary ideas into
practice for the benefit of the community as a whole.

    sector. Created a customized NLP model and deployed it on a

    Understood how in real world scenarios you might well have to
    reason about the information architecture and to reason on how to
    improve that to suit the analytics component or, alternatively, how to
    adapt the ML model to the information architecture. It is not simply
    to find and apply the most elegant and theoretical compelling ML
    model.

    Understood the importance of facing clients in an appropriate
    way. Do some training in this sense. Facing the client in the right
    way is key to successful projects.
