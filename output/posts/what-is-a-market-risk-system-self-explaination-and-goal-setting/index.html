<p>
So what is a Market Risk System?
</p>

<p>
This post tries to answer that question.
</p>

<p>
This post aims to be the guide for your intrinsic motivation for
working on the system and should pose the basis for reaching higher
goals in your work.
</p>

<p>
It is important to have goals in life.
</p>

<p>
It is the same as in the field of mathematics. People say that once
you have a proper problem definition you are half-way through the
problem, everything else is sequential.
</p>

<p>
So let's define and let's hope then everything will be sequential
then. 
</p>

<h2 id="orgcc54452">On a general overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcc54452">
<p>
In order to proper understand what a market risk system is, I like
the following paper.
</p>

<p>
Even if it is from 1997, I must say that the general idea of the
paper is still very valid.
</p>

<br><br><object data="../../pdfs/infoRiskSystem.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" align="center">
  <iframe jsname="L5Fo6c" jscontroller="usmiIb" jsaction="rcuQ6b:WYd;" class="YMEQtfL6cTce-purZT L6cTce-pSzOP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" src="../../pdfs/infoRiskSystem.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" align="center"></iframe>

<h2 id="orgf771107">Most important take-away points - Fusion with personal experience</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf771107">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org60f9c8d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org60f9c8d">On a system in Motion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60f9c8d">
<p>
I like it the dynamic idea that the paper gives - already from the
abstract the point is clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Technical progress will make this tradeoff more favorable over time,
leading firms to implement more accurate methodologies, such as full
revaluation of nonlinear positions. The current and likely future
improvements in risk management information systems make feasible new
ways of collecting aggregate data on firms' risk-taking activities.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So this is your first important take-away: <b>never think the system
as static</b>.
</p>

<p>
Embrace the modern technological advances and the cloud-native
software development movement in order to push the boundaries of
your system to the technological natural barriers.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org571dbc3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org571dbc3">On a conservative mind-set</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org571dbc3">
<p>
I like as well a lot the point made in the first chapter. This is
very true. From a technological view-point the system is not even
super-complex. There are much more data-heavy and involving systems
around. However, what is challenging is the essential complexity of
Market Risk. Trust me to properly understand the internal capital
modeling of a large insurance is not a trivial task.
</p>

<p>
Add on the top of it, the history of the industry that is causing a
very traditional mindset that makes the companies very resistent to
a full appreciation of the power of modern IT architectures and you
soon will realize the difficulty of setting up a state of the art
risk system in the industry.
</p>

<p>
People working in the industry are very clever. They see the
tech-advances and they realize the world is changing. Still they are
very well aware that at the end their core-business is finance. In
this sense I think that, at least to some degree, the focus is not
to waste too much energies in developing the most advanced risk
system being always up to date with the latest technological
trend. At least not if in terms of output there is no tangible
benefit for the risk capturing mechanism and no added value across
the investement management value chain.
</p>

<p>
For instance, there is little interest if the system takes 1-2 days
for running the entire simulations or 2 h. Do you save lots of money
doing it? No. Does the migration involve risk? Yes. Does the
migration involve costs and bounds resources for a longer period of
time? Yes. Well… then you see that is tough for the management to
give the green light to such a shift given the complexity of the
project and the fact that there is little interest for them to have
a super fast state of the art system.
</p>

<p>
So this is the general field you are playing in. On the one hand, it
might be a bit demotivating for a person always interested in the
last technological advances. On the other hand, it is interesting
cause there is a lot to do and I believe that once you will grow
your skills and gain confidence from the management by delivering
successfull projects the management will allow yourself more room as
they will trust your judgment relating to the second point:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does the migration involve risk? Yes - but I am confident we can
do it in a smooth way.</li>
</ul>
<p>
as a reality.

<div id="outline-container-org91577c9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org91577c9">On a trade-off</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91577c9">
<p>
Of course there are different trade-offs when designing your market
risk systems.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the types of instruments that your business deals with
you might have risks that are more difficult to price and requires
more heavy computational efforts.
</p>

<p>
Think in this sense about complex derivatives with particular
pay-offs.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it your market risk model might use stronger and more
rigid assumptions such as the delta-normal also called the
J.P. Morgan RiskMetrics<sup>TM</sup> methodology or more flexible approaches
such as the full revaluation Monte-Carlo approaches mentioned in
the paper.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious then that you have a trade-off of accuracy
vs. complexity of the system and you as a company have to decide
where to position yourself on that curve.
</p>

<p>
Note that you would ultimately see the curve trade-off twist in
time due to the technological progress as well depicted in the
paper.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202021-11-28%20115921.png" class="center"><p>
This leads me to the following goal-setting for myself in the industry.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org322e254" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org322e254">Goal-setting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org322e254">
<p>
So your goal in this industry is to keep up with the technological
change in order to stay always on the current line given the
techonological progress.
</p>

<img src="../../images/goalSet.png" class="center"><p>
We all know that due to the budget constrains, mind-set constrains,
limited amount of time and the continuously moving curve - at a
very high speed recently - it will be impossible to always lie on
the line.
</p>

<p>
Make sure at least that you are not to far off that line and
convince your people by example that it is possible to stay close
to the line with the correct attitute.
</p>

<p>
Quite challenging but that will be the goal.
