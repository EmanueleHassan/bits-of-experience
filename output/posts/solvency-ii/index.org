So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.

This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.

On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.

Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.

   - Note as well the [[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/927345/Solvency_II_Call_for_Evidence.pdf][UK review of it]]. Interesting to see and get an
     idea about the different viewpoints based on the market. Will
     help you a bit to understand both solvency II as well as
     understanding better the general space you are moving in.

     /Update 19/04:/ Note that this is as well interesting. During the
     last weekend started a query on google news about solvency II.

     There is a big discussion about it and a possible reform that is
     coming. They were as well citing that UK review as a thing worth
     of consideration. So you see how everything is interrelated. Like
     in software ultimately. Everyone coping each other but in the end
     interrelation is big.

   - Other possible [[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fgpp.2008.43.pdf][good read]] - there are as well sources
     there.

     That is in fact true. From it you basically immediately find the
     following source, which is the important one. Not academic but
     rather targeted to EU commission. Thorough reading. With it you
     should ultimately understand the thing.

   - [[https://www.knf.gov.pl/knf/pl/komponenty/img/Assessment_of_the_overall_financial_position_of_an_insuranc_18428.pdf][KPMG on behalf of EU Commission - study into methodologies to
     assess fin. pos of an insurance]]

** Technical Provisions

   Technical provisions represent the amount that the insurance company
   would have to pay in order to transfer its obligations immediately
   to another insurance company.

   #+begin_export html
    <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-04-10 173239.png" class="center">
   #+end_export
  

   Solvency II requires that technical provisions be calculated as the
   sum of the best estimate of the liability and a risk margin to cover
   the cost of the capital another insurer would need to hold to take on
   the liability.

   So you see the first bridge. The concept of risk margin is the
   pillar of both methodologies, when transferring claims to other
   insurances in case of stress.
   
** ORSA

   So this is an interesting component of solvency II. Did not find it
   that far in SST.

   The idea is that through such =Own Risk and Solvency Assessment=
   you:

   #+begin_quote
will cover not just the current risk profile and governance
arrangements, but how these might change going forward, in the light
of the commercial and strategic intentions of the insurer and the
nature of the risks being run

Understanding the evolution of an insurer’s balance sheet requires
technical expertise in modelling as well as a /deep understanding of
risk and other influences on insurance cash flows/.

A robust and effective ORSA process will require input from technical
experts who are not just able to meet the intellectual and technical
challenges of the work, but who are also able to communicate the key
technical considerations and translate the output into implications
for potential strategy and business decisions

* Important Notes from the KPMG paper

  Note that this paper was in fact what I was looking for.

  In order to understand the various solvency regulations for the
  insurance companies it starts from the scratch and it gives a solid
  overview about the general business model and risk of insurances.

  So that is actually cool as like this you can continue to make order
  and understand what is around you at a larger scope. This will help
  you to set things in perspective and will help you to understand the
  /why/ of certain things and understand /where/ they are coming. 
  
*** On a note about risk transfer products

    Check at the following points:

    #+begin_quote
    The use of alternative risk transfer products can produce significant
    financial impacts, which can be difficult to assess unless accounting
    treatments are appropriate and disclosures are sufficient. It is
    important to separate those contracts which provide genuine risk
    mitigation from those which seek to create regulatory arbitrage
    through financing and other arrangements.
    #+end_quote

    Understand what is what in your system. Cause you have a component
    that goes into that dimension. Understand if there is a distinction
    for such risk transfer instruments.

*** Risks Categorization

    Good sum up of the wider risks - some you see in your models.
    
**** Entity risks

     These are more under the company control.

*** Practical Issues in Setting up proper risk models

    #+begin_quote
The main practical issue is the quality and ease of use of these
models. Typically companies use a financial model that is not
connected to the main accounting system, although some are able to use
the same system that they use for budgeting and financial
planning. For example, the Canadian experience was that the
implementation of DCAT models was normally done by establishing a
stand-alone computer model, most often using microcomputer templates,
rather than by major system changes to extend the existing main
accounting and statistical systems.
    #+end_quote

    Obviously some parts of this quote are outdated as 22 years have
    gone by, but I must say that part of it is still quite relevant. 


*** Risks in terms of Balance Sheets

    #+begin_quote
The principal risk in non-life insurance business is that claims
incurred will be greater than expected. In *balance sheet terms*, this
is the risk that the provisions will be insufficient to meet claims
payable.
    #+end_quote
    
    Also interesting is the benchmark with Banking

    #+begin_quote
In the banking sector the principal risk is that losses will be
greater than expected. Whilst the liabilities of a bank are generally
fixed and known there is generally no concept of dynamic provisioning
in the banking market which would create provisions for future losses
or claims. Additional uncertainty exists in banks where they write
derivatives or option contracts. There are now well established
mathematical processes for estimating the risk, by measuring the price
volatility of the underlying instrument or exchange rate.
    #+end_quote

    /Side-note for you/: Understand that stress tests of banks are
    nothing else than scenario analysis. Meaning the scenario shocks
    as you explained them in your notes about SST. This has obvious
    pro and cons. There is an entire section about it around
    3.10.45. You can read over there if interested.
    

*** Credit Risk Portfolio

    Note the following - which does in fact hold very true in my
    experience.

    #+begin_quote
Credit risk is a major concern for banks and regulators. (Recall where
the major risks for the banks lies - on the asset side loans.)

Historically it has been the principal cause of bank failures and
generally remains so, even for banks whose main business lines involve
trading activities. However, progress in the development of portfolio
credit risk modelling has been far slower than the development of VaR
models.  Credit risk models are used to varying extents by banks, but
regulators are not yet close to being able to recognise models in the
capital setting process. It should also be noted that insurance
companies seldom use sophisticated risk models to measure their
exposure to credit risk.

Difficulties faced by regulators in recognising portfolio credit risk
models in the capital setting process are found in each of the three
basic requirements for model recognition referred to earlier. In
particular, regulators have found that such models, where they exist,
are not usually used as an integrated part of the risk management
process; in other words, management do not rely on the models. A key
reason for this lies in another of the basic requirements: back
testing of credit risk models is problematic.
    #+end_quote


*** On a failed holistic view

    So we have an holistic view in comparison to other players. I
    don't think that there is any modeled dependency across the
    different risks. I think that this is as well not a too big design
    flaw as some risks belongs in fact to very different schema in the
    world.

    #+begin_quote
Risk modelling in the insurance sector shows a limited trend towards
holistic modelling, which tries to capture the total risk profile of
the undertaking (currently the reserve of only the most sophisticated
insurers).

Banks, however, tend to look at market, credit and operational risk
categories separately and apart from VaR models for trading risks,
little account if any is taken of correlations between different
risks.
    #+end_quote
    

*** Interesting is the component of Back-testing

    In the banking world with Basel you have the requirement to
    back-test your VaR model.

    #+begin_quote
    In order to test the efficiency and accuracy of a VaR model a run
    of data is required to compare the expected results predicted by
    the model with the actual outcome. Models typically are updated
    and refined over time, so a period of several years would not be
    a realistic test because the model will have been modified over
    such a period. On the other hand, a period of a few weeks does
    not give a sufficiently long run of observations to provide a
    statistically significant test. 250 observations is a compromise
    and conveniently represents about a yearís data. 
    #+end_quote

    Double check if this is a component of interest in the insurance
    space. Does not seem to be the case to this stage. 
    

*** Chapter 8 - Impact of changes in accounting standards

    This must be an interesting chapter. There is now a lot of buzz
    about IFRS 19.

    The conceptual idea is the following:

    #+begin_quote
Accounting is *fundamental to any solvency system* as accounting
requirements drive the net assets position in the financial statements
which is usually the starting point for the solvency system.

Under the current European system, changes in accounting rules for
technical provisions will also impact on the calculation of the
solvency margin requirement. (DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS UP TO DATE - QUITE
OLD PAPER - IN ANY CASE NICE SUCH PAPERS AS THEY GIVE PERSPECTIVE)
    #+end_quote
