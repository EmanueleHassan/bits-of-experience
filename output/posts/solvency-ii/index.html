<p>
So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.
</p>

<p>
This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.

Note that the information contained in this post is originating
through the following sources:

<li><a href="http://www.actuaries.org/CTTEES_TFSP/Documents/Hague_Item3c_GC_Solvency2.pdf">solvency II - actuarial docu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For understanding changes and debates around solvency II:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://www.actuary.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Solvency-II-Risk-Margin-FINAL-1.pdf">A review of the design of solvency II risk margin</a>.</li>

<li>
<p>
Note as well the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/927345/Solvency_II_Call_for_Evidence.pdf">UK review of it</a>. Interesting to see and get an
idea about the different viewpoints based on the market. Will
help you a bit to understand both solvency II as well as
understanding better the general space you are moving in.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update 19/04:</i> Note that this is as well interesting. During the
last weekend started a query on google news about solvency II.
</p>

<p>
There is a big discussion about it and a possible reform that is
coming. They were as well citing that UK review as a thing worth
of consideration. So you see how everything is interrelated. Like
in software ultimately. Everyone coping each other but in the end
interrelation is big.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Other possible <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/gpp.2008.43.pdf">good read</a> - there are as well sources
there.
</p>

<p>
That is in fact true. From it you basically immediately find the
following source, which is the important one. Not academic but
rather targeted to EU commission. Thorough reading. With it you
should ultimately understand the thing.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://www.knf.gov.pl/knf/pl/komponenty/img/Assessment_of_the_overall_financial_position_of_an_insuranc_18428.pdf">KPMG on behalf of EU Commission - study into methodologies to

<div id="outline-container-org3e11167" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3e11167">Technical Provisions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3e11167">
<p>
Technical provisions represent the amount that the insurance company
would have to pay in order to transfer its obligations immediately
to another insurance company.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-04-10%20173239.png" class="center"><p>
Solvency II requires that technical provisions be calculated as the
sum of the best estimate of the liability and a risk margin to cover
the cost of the capital another insurer would need to hold to take on
the liability.
</p>

<p>
So you see the first bridge. The concept of risk margin is the
pillar of both methodologies, when transferring claims to other
insurances in case of stress.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2ac7a17" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2ac7a17">ORSA</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ac7a17">
<p>
So this is an interesting component of solvency II. Did not find it
that far in SST.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that through such <code>Own Risk and Solvency Assessment</code>
you:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
will cover not just the current risk profile and governance
arrangements, but how these might change going forward, in the light
of the commercial and strategic intentions of the insurer and the
nature of the risks being run
</p>

<p>
Understanding the evolution of an insurer’s balance sheet requires
technical expertise in modelling as well as a <i>deep understanding of
risk and other influences on insurance cash flows</i>.
</p>

<p>
A robust and effective ORSA process will require input from technical
experts who are not just able to meet the intellectual and technical
challenges of the work, but who are also able to communicate the key
technical considerations and translate the output into implications
for potential strategy and business decisions

<h2 id="org2025acf">Important Notes from the KPMG paper</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2025acf">
<p>
Note that this paper was in fact what I was looking for.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the various solvency regulations for the
insurance companies it starts from the scratch and it gives a solid
overview about the general business model and risk of insurances.
</p>

<p>
So that is actually cool as like this you can continue to make order
and understand what is around you at a larger scope. This will help
you to set things in perspective and will help you to understand the
<i>why</i> of certain things and understand <i>where</i> they are coming.

<p>
Check at the following points:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The use of alternative risk transfer products can produce significant
financial impacts, which can be difficult to assess unless accounting
treatments are appropriate and disclosures are sufficient. It is
important to separate those contracts which provide genuine risk
mitigation from those which seek to create regulatory arbitrage
through financing and other arrangements.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Understand what is what in your system. Cause you have a component
that goes into that dimension. Understand if there is a distinction
for such risk transfer instruments.

<h4 id="org2347a73">Practical Issues in Setting up proper risk models</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2347a73">
<blockquote>
<p>
The main practical issue is the quality and ease of use of these
models. Typically companies use a financial model that is not
connected to the main accounting system, although some are able to use
the same system that they use for budgeting and financial
planning. For example, the Canadian experience was that the
implementation of DCAT models was normally done by establishing a
stand-alone computer model, most often using microcomputer templates,
rather than by major system changes to extend the existing main
accounting and statistical systems.

<div id="outline-container-org0fa7790" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0fa7790">Risks in terms of Balance Sheets</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0fa7790">
<blockquote>
<p>
The principal risk in non-life insurance business is that claims
incurred will be greater than expected. In <b>balance sheet terms</b>, this
is the risk that the provisions will be insufficient to meet claims
payable.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also interesting is the benchmark with Banking
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the banking sector the principal risk is that losses will be
greater than expected. Whilst the liabilities of a bank are generally
fixed and known there is generally no concept of dynamic provisioning
in the banking market which would create provisions for future losses
or claims. Additional uncertainty exists in banks where they write
derivatives or option contracts. There are now well established
mathematical processes for estimating the risk, by measuring the price
volatility of the underlying instrument or exchange rate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Side-note for you</i>: Understand that stress tests of banks are
nothing else than scenario analysis. Meaning the scenario shocks
as you explained them in your notes about SST. This has obvious
pro and cons. There is an entire section about it around
3.10.45. You can read over there if interested.

<div id="outline-container-org2dc1478" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2dc1478">Credit Risk Portfolio</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2dc1478">
<p>
Note the following - which does in fact hold very true in my
experience.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Credit risk is a major concern for banks and regulators. (Recall where
the major risks for the banks lies - on the asset side loans.)
</p>

<p>
Historically it has been the principal cause of bank failures and
generally remains so, even for banks whose main business lines involve
trading activities. However, progress in the development of portfolio
credit risk modelling has been far slower than the development of VaR
models.  Credit risk models are used to varying extents by banks, but
regulators are not yet close to being able to recognise models in the
capital setting process. It should also be noted that insurance
companies seldom use sophisticated risk models to measure their
exposure to credit risk.
</p>

<p>
Difficulties faced by regulators in recognising portfolio credit risk
models in the capital setting process are found in each of the three
basic requirements for model recognition referred to earlier. In
particular, regulators have found that such models, where they exist,
are not usually used as an integrated part of the risk management
process; in other words, management do not rely on the models. A key
reason for this lies in another of the basic requirements: back
testing of credit risk models is problematic.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-org8c0028a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8c0028a">On a failed holistic view</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c0028a">
<p>
So we have an holistic view in comparison to other players. I
don't think that there is any modeled dependency across the
different risks. I think that this is as well not a too big design
flaw as some risks belongs in fact to very different schema in the
world.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Risk modelling in the insurance sector shows a limited trend towards
holistic modelling, which tries to capture the total risk profile of
the undertaking (currently the reserve of only the most sophisticated
insurers).
</p>

<p>
Banks, however, tend to look at market, credit and operational risk
categories separately and apart from VaR models for trading risks,
little account if any is taken of correlations between different
risks.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgd0e8a29" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd0e8a29">Interesting is the component of Back-testing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd0e8a29">
<p>
In the banking world with Basel you have the requirement to
back-test your VaR model.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In order to test the efficiency and accuracy of a VaR model a run
of data is required to compare the expected results predicted by
the model with the actual outcome. Models typically are updated
and refined over time, so a period of several years would not be
a realistic test because the model will have been modified over
such a period. On the other hand, a period of a few weeks does
not give a sufficiently long run of observations to provide a
statistically significant test. 250 observations is a compromise
and conveniently represents about a yearís data. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Double check if this is a component of interest in the insurance
space. Does not seem to be the case to this stage.
</p>

<p>
Also interesting the frequency of the risk. Note that in banks
risks are computed at daily level. This because in the banking
model the big exposures on the trading books change at the daily
level.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga7ca7e3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga7ca7e3">Technical Liabilities / Provisions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga7ca7e3">
<p>
See definition above. 
</p>

<p>
The way you calculate it has profound impact on the way an
insurance writes its business and its ultimate ability to be
profitable and face rough seas.
</p>

<p>
The topics discussed in the KPMG paper are essentially the
following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>claims handling provisions;</li>

<li>discounting;</li>

<li>best practice and new trends in relation to the determination of
outstanding claims;</li>

<li>the need and possibility for harmonisation at a European and
international level.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
So you see that it is the usual topic that you face when checking
at these regulatory exercises.
</p>

<p>
Have to calculate risks, there is a degree of flexibility, have to
set standards and monitor in order to make sure that no player has
a competitive advantage over the others.
</p>

<p>
This is enough for the moment for the chapter as it is not part of
the risk that I am covering. Went quickly through it in order to
get an idea. At the end it is always the same stuff. Check at the
chapter with the different statistical methodologies in there
should you get interested at any point in time in it.

<p>
This must be an interesting chapter. There is now a lot of buzz
about IFRS 19.
</p>

<p>
The conceptual idea is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Accounting is <b>fundamental to any solvency system</b> as accounting
requirements drive the net assets position in the financial statements
which is usually the starting point for the solvency system.
</p>

<p>
Under the current European system, changes in accounting rules for
technical provisions will also impact on the calculation of the
solvency margin requirement. (DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS UP TO DATE - QUITE
OLD PAPER - IN ANY CASE NICE SUCH PAPERS AS THEY GIVE PERSPECTIVE)
