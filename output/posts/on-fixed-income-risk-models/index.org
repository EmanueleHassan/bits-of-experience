So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.

At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.

I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.

Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.

Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.

Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution][following entry]].

* On fixed income attribution models

  So what these models do is to decompose the risk of fixed-income
  instruments in different components. You would then price the
  different components and ultimately aggregate the risk of them.

** Interest Rate Risk

   So I will start in this post with the interest rate risk. I will
   then check at other risk-factors as I go along. 
  
   So the yield-curve and interest rate risk is just one among the many
   factors. However, this is an important one.

   Note that if you use your standard duration models you can perform
   analysis of the risks for the case of parallel movements of the
   yield-curve.

   What happens though in the case of other more non-linear
   movements? There you have to think in terms of different models
   that can capture such shifts.

   This is the reason why you can use factor-based models for the
   interest reate curve that capture such non-linearities.

   A typical decomposition in this sense is the:

   - shift
 
   - twist 

   - butterfly

   decomposition.

   So note that the butterfly acts more on the curvature of the yield
   curve hitting in multiple points.

   In contrast, the twist is more acting on the first-order level
   changing the steepness of the yield curve but holding the general
   curvature structure. Note that by definition changing the twist
   will affect the curvature, and having a butterfly will affect the
   steepness of the curve. The two are therefore not completely
   isolated. Would be fun at some point to read more into the
   mathematical relation of the two but as having enough things on
   your plate this is jumped at the moment - and likely forever. 

   Once you have a factor model for the yield-curve taking into
   account the three elements and mapping the influence of each on the
   yield curve you can start to make all of your scenario based on
   it.

   The simple idea as in the Nelson-Siegel model is the following:

   -> you have your observable yield curve and the given interest
   rates at different maturities composing the curve.

   -> you have a function composed of constants terms (measuring
   shifts), first order terms (measuring twist) and more complex terms
   (measuring butterfly).

   You then parameterize the influence of each term in order to get
   the best possible representation of the *current* yield curve
   (standard OLS / minimization exercise).

   Once you found your parameteric representation of the yield curve
   depending on that factors you can make your standard sensitivities
   analysis by standard math-analysis arguments.

   I.e. you can generate the simulations for the different terms
   tweaking your yield curve. Based on the simulation of these few
   terms you are actually generating possible simulations of the yield
   curve. This because what you actually have is a model for the
   entire yield curve based on the simple shift-twist-butterfly
   terms. Given the parameterization of the effect of each you then
   have a new simulated state for your yield curve that you can use to
   price your fixed interest rate instruments.    

   *Important side note:* Note that the above is a simplified
   explaination of the model. In the models you actually have two kind
   of parameters. Paramters defining the influence of each shape term
   on the yield curve and decay factor parameters defining the
   location of the "humps" of the butterfly terms. But the main idea
   stays and you can easily understand how it works even with these
   terms. 

   So this is a little bit the logic you reason with in the market
   risk model for capturing the interest rate risk.
