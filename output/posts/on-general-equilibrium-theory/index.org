#+END_COMMENT


This post deals with equilibria in economics theory.

I was always fascinated by the topic. I wanted to go in the topic at
some point but I postponed. 

Recent experiences just increased that fascination. /There is a rhythm
and reason to the wild out there/.

It is that invisible hand. Even in chaos theory there is an
equilibrium. "Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness
of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns,
interconnection, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity,
fractals, and self-organization." (source: Wiki)

I want to study these underlying patterns and the theory economics has
developed to address them. 

After all once you understand the rhythm it is just an exercise of
getting the harmonics of the chaos.

Note that the notes are based on Starr's: General Equilibrium Theory book.

** Partial vs. General Equilibrium

   The fact is that in the basic courses of economics you simply study
   the notion of partial equilibrium.

   I.e. all things being equal in the particular market the
   equilibrium price is where supply and demand curve cross. 

   Then it simply an exercise of mapping supply and demand curves. 

   Such curves may shift in time as /all things change/. But no matter
   what, /panta rhei/; you will get a new equilibrium price for the
   specific market and all things being equal it will stay.

   This book studies the case of /general equilibrium/. I.e. it is a
   microeconomics analysis of the macro equilibrium so to say. That all
   things being equal will be treated such that a market affect the
   other as it is the case in our complex world. 

   We will hence treat /models/ that tackle this issue.

   So you generalize the single market equilibrium condition to the
   general equilibrium condition:

** Decentralized Markets

   The assumption in economics is the one of decentralized markets.

   One of the recurrent notions is to characterize the competitive
   market as /decentralized/. 

   The idea of decentralization is that the complex interactive
   economic system is characterized by many independent decision
   makers who do not cooperate explicitly with one another.

   Nevertheless, their actions turn out to be consistent with one
   another because prices have adjusted for consistency and all the
   decision makers respond (separately and independently) to prices
   that are common to all.

   So you have to keep this assumption in mind and decide to what
   degree that is fulfilled. It is for sure true but there are things
   of national interests where governments kick in.

   The channel through which they will affect the actors is the one of
   the price. So if you understand how the general equilibrium works
   you might even get some intuition about the effect of some price
   intervention from the governments.
   
   You studied all of this at macro-level already. What central banks
   are doing is essentially this. 

   Note that this theory is in between that very high level macro view
   and the very micro one.

   In fact the book addresses the following topics of a general
   equilibrium:
