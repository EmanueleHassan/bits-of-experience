So I recently started to work with the Brave browser. I started to see
it on a LinkIn cryptocurrency influencer webpage and I was rather
suspicious. I noticed it but I did not further investigate. I just had
integrated =DuckDuckGo= into my Chrome browser and I was feeling ok
with that at the time.

I started to get quite interested in it when I saw that the Prof. of
Communication Networks of the University I am currently visiting was
using it. He, as an expert using the browser. There must be some
goodness in it.

So I further investigated and it turned out that there is quite
potential in the browser. I decided to give it a try and I did not
regret it. I will not make a big post about it as it is not in my
style and there are better sources out there in the world wide web.

The bottom line is that it is a very neat product. It is based on
Chromium so it makes the transaction from Chrome very smooth. You can
easily import all of your bookmarks and all of the shortcuts are the
same. It automatically blocks many trackers and advertisements making
your browser experience faster as it saves you the time of loading all
that annoying stuff.

Finally, it gives you the option to activate the option to earn
=BATs=, the browser cryptocurrency, to view some adds the browser will
display every now and then. Don't really expect to make money out of
it - maybe a decent burger per year - I am trying that out of
curiosity right now, but I think I will switch off the option soon as
I find it distracting sometimes.

As a last note, it is interesting the option to be rewarded as a
creator by other users. I just verified my Github page and the
experience was quite smooth.
