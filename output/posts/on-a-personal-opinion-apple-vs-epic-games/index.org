Personal Opinion. I think that the Epic Games - Apple dispute is big.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

I think regulators should make the right call now. With arm on Mac
processors and an Apple ecosystem that would double down its efficacy,
in a couple of years the situation might be worse.

Apple could dictate an even stronger line to software developers in
order to enter their ecosystem. This goes against competition and sets
limits to innovation.

Let's see how it will turn out. As of 21/02/2021 this is my claim.
