So starting to make a little bit of order and starting to deploy

<p>
That is nothing fancy at all. Just basics stuff. With it you can start

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-org4f28ebb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4f28ebb">Choosing the right subscription</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4f28ebb">
<p>
Ok so had a little bit of an hiccup at the beginning. Could not find
the new subscription to the sandbox environment I could get for
experimenting on the cloud.
</p>

<p>
Turns out that I had to make a new login to my account. With the
previous login there was no update.
</p>

<p>
Weird stuff.
</p>

<p>
Anyways after doing that I could see both of my subscriptions - to
the secure env and to the sandbox
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  az account list -o table
</pre></div>

<p>
Now it is possible to specify the subscriptionId of that table and
the resource group and directly set up stuff over there.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org84fa9c5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org84fa9c5">One Good tool to monitor your application - Kudu</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org84fa9c5">
<p>
This is an open source project you would need to understand more if
you will work a lot with webapps.
</p>

<p>
You can read it over <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/windows-azure-websites-online-tools-you-should-know-about/">here</a>. Or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/resources-kudu">here</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that when deploying your apps there is always a runtime of such
Kudu suite. You can understand better how to work with it.
</p>

<p>
To this stage I just understand that this is a project that makes it
possible to manage and monitor your webapps.
</p>

<p>
In this sense the Kudu API that is often mentioned as a possibility
on the microsoft webpage is interacting with that deployed project
that will steer your app.
</p>

<p>
See for instance <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-language-java?pivots=platform-linux#starting-jar-apps">here</a>. You see that you are actually deploying your
war to that endpoint. There a bit of magic must also happen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> there you have as well a bash shell which has a much higher
response time in comparison to the ssh option.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org82f11d5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org82f11d5">Java</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org82f11d5">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc947fc8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc947fc8">Choosing the runtime</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc947fc8">
<p>
So the first thing is to choose the right config for your
applications.
</p>

<p>
You can check at the available runtimes with the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   az webapp list-runtimes --os linux <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">"JAVA\|TOMCAT\|JBOSSEAP"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Interesting is that there is for instance no <code>Jetty</code> server. Given
your recent exploration into async programming and the power of such
server in that dimension I am struck that azure did not offer such
an option yet.
</p>

<p>
Note that different runtimes need different packaging of the
underlying bytecode. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org034d466" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org034d466">Gradle Deployment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org034d466">
<p>
There is a nice plug-in in both gradle and maven that will handle
the deployment and set up of webapps resources.
</p>

<p>
You can check it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-language-java?pivots=platform-linux#deploying-your-app">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then basically through the plug-in you will have a new command that
will create your webapp with the given specifications of your
choice.
</p>

</pre></div>

<p>
Good.
</p>

<p>
Note that in general the above is good but should be now embedded in
a bigger devOps logic. Otherwise it makes little sense.
</p>

<p>
The other option is to abstract in the DevOps from all of this. Just
create a proper environment with all of the relevant
resources. Deploy then to that targeted resources. 
</p>

<p>
Anyways that is a different topic that will just come in time. Back
to it. Will be useful in any case for my sandbox env. I will have to
decide soon how I want to work over there.
</p>

<p>
Now there is a bit of a distinction you have to do depending on the
server you are using for your deployment.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7207e68" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7207e68">JAVA SE</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7207e68">
<p>
This should be the way to run SpringBoot on Linux. It is clearly
stated by one person of the App service team on the Microsoft
blogs.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/fe9e80d4-7263-46d4-891c-bf38ca4fcc25/azure-webapp-http-status-404-8211-not-found?forum=windowsazurewebsitespreview">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
So start to work through such server if there is no strong point
for continuing along the way of TOMCAT.
</p>

<p>
Would need to talk with the team.
</p>

<p>
If you work with such server everything is straightforward; you
just
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    gradle azureWebAppDeploy
</pre></div>

<p>
and badaboom. Everything will work smoothly.
</p>

<p>
Your application is converted to an <code>app.jar</code> in
<code>/home/site/wwwroot</code> and everything will be unpackaged and run
correctly.
</p>

<p>
It just may take a while.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd26510b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd26510b">TOMCAT</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd26510b">
<p>
So here the thing is a bit different as your TOMCAT reads and works
with <code>.war</code>.
</p>

<p>
So the first step is to build a <code>.war</code> and pass it to the TOMCAT
within the WebApp in the proper way. 
</p>

<p>
Note now that if you deploy a Spring application things are slightly
more tricky.
</p>

<p>
This is because by default Spring packages everything into a
<code>.jar</code>. You can then execute that <code>.jar</code> in gradle via the standard
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    ./gradlew.bat bootRun
</pre></div>

<p>
If you want to understand more about that concept check at your
notes <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/spring/">here</a> in the deployment section.
</p>

<p>
Now understand that under the hood when you deploy with the plug-in
above the thing will not simply start the server but will start as
well to deploy the artifact of your application.
</p>

<p>
Now understand that the TOMCAT server is set up to deploy
applications packaged as <code>.war</code> not as <code>.jar</code>.
</p>

<p>
In this sense is of paramount importance when deploying spring
applications to apply as well the <code>war</code> plugin such that everything
will be packaged as a <code>war</code> in the correct default location and your
webapp with your TOMCAT runtime can boot the application correctly.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">plugins</span> <span class="p">{</span>

	<span class="c1">// Spring Plug-ins</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then with it you can deploy your application in the following way
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    gradle azureWebAppDeploy
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that in such a case you deploy a <code>.war</code> to the
<code>/home/site/wwwroot</code>.
</p>

<p>
So not good enough as you should live in the
<code>/home/site/wwwroot/webapps</code>.
</p>

<p>
Check now the following testing etc.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org10303fe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org10303fe">
<span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> open issues</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org10303fe">
<p>
Not working correctly. The application seems to be deployed but I
cannot hit the endpoint. Get 404 error.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/fe9e80d4-7263-46d4-891c-bf38ca4fcc25/azure-webapp-http-status-404-8211-not-found?forum=windowsazurewebsitespreview">following issue</a>. This actually put me off the road. Weird
stuff…. should work according to my mind.
</p>

<p>
So not clear to this stage.
</p>

<p>
This is a bit what happens in my team. No idea where to put the
<code>.war</code> so weird pipelines are being created that finally reproduce
the structure of a TOMCAT.
</p>

<p>
You could then force everything in a similar way along these lines
by following the thing over <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-war-tomcat-deploy">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
What is weird that in such a case you are not leveraging the magic
of PaaS and for what is worth you could then well go for IaaS in
this sense.
</p>

<p>
So makes totally no sense.
</p>

<p>
So will need to fix that at some point when the right moment will
come. 
</p>

<p>
Giving up for now as it is taking too much time and I have to move
on with other work. Posted a Question on StackOverflow. Try to
check what answers you get over there. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71584566/deploying-a-war-on-azure-webapps-tomcat-server">Monitor it</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Talked with Valerio. It seems that everything I am doing is
correct.
</p>

<p>
So I really do not understand what is going on. Try not with the
free tier.
</p>

<p>
Note that you can as well use the <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deploying-WAR-files-using-wardeploy">Kudu API</a>. Good reference as well
to understand what is happening under the hood.
</p>

<p>
For these you need your webapp credentials. You can get them <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-configure-credentials?tabs=cli">like
that</a>.
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group &lt;group-name&gt; --name &lt;app-name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
This is actually what you did the first time when deploying your
applications to the cloud. Had to go there via UI and get that
info and store it in a config file.
</p>

<p>
Obviously not the best. I guess in any case that is really the same
as deploying with the <code>az webapp deploy</code> command directly which is
already integrated with your credentials.
</p>

<p>
So that cannot be it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgde70413">
<p>
This section deals with the deployment of python runtimes.
</p>

<p>
I am still considering some best of breed approach. I still have to
consider as managing two stacks concurrently will not be a trivial
task.
</p>

<p>
If you manage to properly set up a devOps pipeline for it, it might
be easier then. Check with the team to see at what point we are in
this dimension.
</p>

<p>
In any case the way to do it is well outlined <a href="https://medium.com/@nikovrdoljak/deploy-your-flask-app-on-azure-in-3-easy-steps-b2fe388a589e">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note this way of interacting with Kudu. This is a little bit
different to the one you explored so far.
</p>

<p>
It is nonetheless the way through which we interact with AzureWebapp
so far in the Java stack in your team in production. The way to work
directly with gradle and specify all of the pipelines in there is not
the way decided by the team. So check at how the situation develops
across time.

<div id="outline-container-orge6819ed" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge6819ed">Creating an Application</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge6819ed">
<p>
You can do it with the <code>az webapp up [args]</code> command.
</p>

<p>
So for instance you can specify
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   az webapp up--runtime PYTHON:3.7 <span class="se">\</span>
       --sku F1 <span class="se">\</span>

<div id="outline-container-org41dd49b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org41dd49b">Deploying</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org41dd49b">
<p>
So note that this section will be relevant as well for understand
the general set up and how you currently deploy the applications on
azure.
</p>

<p>
So basically what you can do it to set a user specific crendential
to deploy to the webapps.
</p>

<p>
You can start in such a way for your sandbox, then again in devOps
with the pipelines everything will be integrated.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that there is an application specific <code>user</code> and
<code>password</code> that you can theoretically use to deploy over there.
</p>

<p>
Once you set your options for a specific subscription you can as
well use this. This is actually better as you can then see who did
what.
</p>

<p>
You can view your user configurations for depoying to a webapp
under a specific subscription in the following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   az webapp deployment user show --subscription &lt;blabla&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that I think that the password parameter is not displayed even
when it is set.
</p>

<p>
You can set it via shell for a specific subscription via:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   az webapp deployment user <span class="nb">set</span> --subscription &lt;blabla&gt; --password <span class="o">{</span>password<span class="o">}</span> --user-name MyUserName
</pre></div>

<p>
Then with it it will be possible for you to deploy your code on a
given application.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-orgc84e1f7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc84e1f7">Set up the startup script</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc84e1f7">
<p>
Note that in order to correctly deploy the thing you must follow
some given standards.
</p>

<p>
This is the ugly thing of working with such services instead of
going with Docker directly.
</p>

<p>
You do not really undestand what is going on and I must say that
the official documentation abstracts a little bit too much away.
</p>

<p>
In any case this is my current set-up and in such a way it works.
</p>

<p>
Check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-language-python">here</a> the section: Custom Flask main module.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial">this</a> as an example. Implemented a similar logic with
<code>__init__.py</code> actually implementing the application logic and
another one importing it. So basically have ultimately a
<code>startup.py</code> importing the app.
</p>

<p>
So note now that everything works with a <code>startup.py</code> script and a
<code>requirements.txt</code> file in the higher level of the application
repository you are passing to the webapp.
</p>

<p>
I have something in this setting
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
├───app<sub>init</sub>
├───azurestorage
├───deploymentFiles
├───etl
├───forms
├───log
├───migrations
│   └───versions
├───models
├───postman
├───routes
├───swaggerui
│   ├───css
│   ├───fonts
│   ├───images
│   ├───lang
│   └───lib
├───templates
└───test
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the structure has to be refined. 
</p>

<p>
The only thing you have to add is a strartup command to your app -
see setting -&gt; configuration -&gt; .
</p>

<p>
In my case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   gunicorn --bind<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span>.0.0.0 --timeout <span class="m">600</span> startup:app
</pre></div>

<p>
Just recall the last part which is
<code>&lt;file_you_run_as_script&gt;:&lt;app_name_defined_within&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
You are ready to push then to your app through git and the PaaS
will then start to read and unpackage everything in the right way. 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgf5c729c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf5c729c">Note that the inner architecture of Azure is complex</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5c729c">
<p>
Here the functioning and the hidden inner structrues are more
complex in comparison to the deployment of a Java app.
</p>

<p>
What you actually get in the <code>/home/site/wwwroot</code> is a packaged
Oryx file.
</p>

<p>
So basically that is the piece of software that manages the thing.
</p>

<p>
Then what basically happens is that a directory is created in
<code>/tmp</code>.
</p>

<p>
There a virtual environment will be instantiated, you will download
all of the needed dependencies there and start the app.
</p>

<p>
This will be then the source and the space where your app moves
in. You can see it cause if you log to a file in the project, you
will find the added log of the application over there. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
So you have to get used to the things in life.
</p>

<p>
So basically by deploying via the gradle plugin you do not get a lot
of logged info.
</p>

<p>
So as mentioned it might seem that everything is working properly
when it is not.
</p>

<p>
Or at least will have to understand better how to properly log
everything. In this sense it makes sense to start with the Azure
certification soon. Will help you to gain that knowledge and it will
be a guided tour instead of an unstructured go and conquer.
</p>

<p>
In any case here you will have little info but if the applicaiton
is not able to boot despite the successfuly deployment of the
<code>.jar</code> on the webapp, then you will get an application error
response when trying to hit one of your endpoints.
</p>

<p>
If you then go on the diagnostic tools you should be able to have
an option where you can ultimately see the spring boot application
logs and there you will find the root cause of the issue.
</p>

<p>
Or at least will help you to understand what is going on wrong over
there.

<h3 id="orge54acd0">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge54acd0">
<p>
In the way you deploy via git integration you will get a lot of
feedback.
</p>

<p>
So basically in this way of deploying your can check your
log-stream and you will get a good idea of the issues.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfd4ad2f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfd4ad2f">Use log-stream for debugging</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfd4ad2f">
<p>
This is nice way to check about what is happening in your deployed
webapp.
</p>

<p>
You will see there if the application did not start and it will
give you some hints on what went wrong.
</p>

<p>
This is actually quite annoying of these webapps. I was used to
work in a different way.
</p>

<p>
Either everything started or you would get a failure message.
</p>

<p>
Here you do not necessarily get a failure. Cause if you manage to
upload the files to AzureWebApps then you get a success message.
</p>

<p>
Whether then the PaaS service manages to correcly unpack everything
and start the application out of the box is a different question
for this you would actually have to check at the logs.
</p>

<p>
You can use is it as well to check at your logs for the
application.
</p>

<p>
Note that I was used to write the logs to a file. I have to explore
all of the logging monitoring services more into detail. It is
clear nonetheless that with all of the log services and log queries
services it probably makes sense to log everything directly into
the console.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdf4a392">

How are they constrcuted? What are the specifics?
</p>

<p>
You can find them <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now for testing on the sandbox env that I finally managed to get you
can go with the free tier without any issue.
</p>

<p>
In any case should you in the future need an overview you can check
there cause it is not convenient to fake the mock creation via
web-UI and then exploring there.
