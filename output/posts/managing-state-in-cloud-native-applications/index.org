So this post deals on how to keep the state of the applicaiton in the
new microservices era.

This is a [[https://thenewstack.io/the-state-of-state-in-cloud-native-applications/][major question]] in the cloud-native app development
paradigma. You can summarize the issue as following:

- you want your apps to be stateless such that it is easy to scale and
  heal (recover) them.

- you need to keep track of some states in your overall logic.

Note now that you have to create a suitable architecture that makes
the both objectives possible.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

** Monolith way of doing the thing

   Create a big fat DB holding the state.

** Cloud Native Way of doing it

   You can still keep a DB with the state. But I would guess this is
   not the most clean way of working.

   However, this is still a rather open point in this era. 

   I would rather go with some event-based state solution as mentioned
   [[https://www.lightbend.com/blog/design-techniques-stateful-cloud-native-applications-resilience-recoverability-scalability][here]].

   At the end the idea is the one of actors performing the tasks -
   state is managed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model][actors]]. Each actor holds one state.

   You have event logs such that you can replay the history in case of
   failures. 

   So basically this is a formalization of what you already had in
   mind.

   It is actully fun how many of these patterns comes out of the box
   as possible solution.

** Recall as well the issue of compensating transactions

   Always keep [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction][this]] in the back of your mind when developing in such a
   way.

   I.e. always ask yourself is a compensating-transaction needed?

   How to I keep track of the necessary compensating transactions.
