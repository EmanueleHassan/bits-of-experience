   This is as well another important component; it originates from [[https://www.value-at-risk.net/mappings/][here]].

   I very much like these notes as they allow you to gain that high
   level overview of the subject and high level understanding of the
   thing.

   You can then think under these terms when checking at the thing and
   you can correctly understand the operation you are doing when
   working on the system.

** Portfolio Mappings

*** First of all understand the mapping exercise

    This is of paramount importance and is very core to the way you
    implement your system.

    The essential idea is the following:

    When performing your calculations you rarely directly specify a
    conditional distribution for the value of your portfolio. This is
    hardly feasible due to the complexity of financial markets.

    What you essentially do is express your portfolio value as a linear
    combination of the underlying instruments composing it.

    #+BEGIN_src latex :results drawer :exports results
    \[ P_{i = 1} = w * S] \]
    #+END_src

    #+RESULTS:
    :RESULTS:
    \[ P_{i = 1} = w * S] \]
    :END:


    Note that /w/ is essentially a map from the instruments to the
    portfolio value.

    What you then generally do is not to model the conditional
    distribution of the instruments =S=, but you rather specify
    conditional distribution of the risk factors =R= and specify a map
    from them to the instruments.

    You will have then a general way of expressing your risks by the
    concatenation of maps. The problem would then be more less the
    following:
    
    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 121034.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    In the sense that:

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 132850.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    Finally, the entire process would look at high level as follows:

    #+begin_export html
     <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 132955.png" class="center">
    #+end_export

    So that is it. You have essentially to understand which of piece
    of your system fits in which box but you can reduce everything to
    that.

    I could already map the components I know to this scema. Would be
    cool to map everything to it once I have a clearer understanding
    of the system.


*** Important Mapping Considerations

    The above is quite general. You can think then about how the
    system you are working on handles the thing.

    In general understand the following for the different component
    that you have to specify in the system.

**** Specifying S and w

     I report over here the entire section available [[https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mapping/][here]]:
    
     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 135518.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

**** Specifying R and theta

     Same as above - check at the url above if you want the orginal.

     #+begin_export html
      <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2022-06-15 140507.png" class="center">
     #+end_export

     You undestand well now what our model library is..
