<blockquote>
<p>
A human life, I think, should be well rooted in some spot of a native
land, where it may get the love of tender kinship for the face of
earth, for the labours men go forth to, for the sounds and accents
that haunt it, for whatever will give that early home a familiar
unmistakable difference amidst the future widening of knowledge: a
spot where the definiteness of early memories may be inwrought with
affection.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 2 - Some Spot of a Native Land)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Jewish tradition, Bialik essentially says, is a cancer that has
destroyed the Jew's humanity.
</p>

<p>
For Bialik therefore, and for many of his contemporaries, the point of
Zionism, of the return to the Jewish homeland, was not simply to
create a refuge or to fix the "Jewish problem" in Europe. The reason
that Jews needed to return to their land was that it was only there
that the Jews could fashion a "new Jew". It was time, he insisted, to
re-create the Maccabees of old. It was time for the Jewish nation to
be reborn. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 3 - A Conversation, Not an Ideology)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Suddenly, Vienna is learning that it was no ordinary writer or poet
who has died, but one of those people who shape ideas, the like of
whom appear so rarely on the stages of history.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 3 - A Conversation, Not an Ideology - Talking about Herzl's funeral )
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
A much discussed passage of the Babylonian Talmud refers to three
oaths to which Israel and the nations of the world committed
themselves. The nations of the world swore that they would not oppress
the nation of Israel excessively, while Israel swore not to enter the
Land of Israel by force and not to rebel against the nations of the
world. 
[…]
To them, Zionism - which sought to place history and the fate of the
Jews in human hands - was a violation of the essence of Judaism. The
fact that most of the movement's leadership was not only fiercely
secular, but rabidly antireligious, just confirmed their sense. They
railed against the Zionists and would have nothing to do with them. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 3 - A Conversation, Not an Ideology)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The important takeaway is the following, and this is the
quintessential value and backbone of Israel - pluralism.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When Zionists ultimately succeeded in creating a state, however, all
these rival factions would have to live together in what would become
a hastily declared and built country. As much as they disagreed with
one another, they would have to live, love go to battle, build a
country - and die - together. Israel's fractious politics and
turbulent political life are, in many respects, the result of these
early, unresolved Zionist debates. When it eventually arose, the
Jewish state would be one that Jews were struggling to learn how to
share. As the great Hebrew writer and early Zionist Yosef Brenner put
it, Zionism was in some ways "forced to put forth branches before it
[had] time to strike root."
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 3 - A Conversation, Not an Ideology)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Once Ben-Yehuda and his wife had settled in the Land of Israel in
1881, they spoke only Hebrew to each other and to their children. They
would not permit their children to speak anyone else in any language
other than Hebrew. Since there were, essentially, no other Hebrew
speakers, their children could speak only to their family.
[…]
With time, Ben-Yehuda found partners in the battle. He and a small
group of other Hebrew enthusiasts penned Hebrew literature at an
extraordinary pace.
[…]
It was the classic revolutionary elite versus the rank and file. The
Hebrew writers were determined to create high culture, but the
immigrants were equally desperate to relax, to not work their minds as
hard as they had to work their bodies.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Orthodox establishment had first failed in their attempt to
convince EU Jews not to join the Zionist movement, and now they failed
to derail the revival of Hebrew.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Yavetz's story, the Diaspora Jew refuses to join the pioneer men,
women, and children sitting on the ground and taking pleasure in the
view since it would mean getting his trousers wet. Unlike the
"Tourist", the "Resident" is earthy and active; he is dressed simply
in Arabic style clothing, holds a weapon for self-defense, and rides a
white horse. He embodies health, confidence, and passion for life. He
is Bialik's new Jew who would not hide behind a cask during a pogrom,
a new Jew who is determined to break with his victimlike past, the new
Jew intent on taking control of his destiny. Now, thanks to Yavetz,
that literary discussion of the new Jew had moved from EU to
Palestine, from exile to budding Yishuv.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Brenner was passionate but complex. In a way that would somehow
characterize the Zionist movement in the decades to come, he was both
deeply dedicated to the movement and, at the same time, an unremitting
pessimist.
Intensely committed to creating a new form of Hebrew culture in
Palestine, he sometimes felt that his ideals notwithstanding, there
was nothing utopian about what the Zionists were building. Exile, he
said, had simply relocated to the Land of Israel. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the Six-Day War, "kibbutz members were represented among the war
casualties at a rate almost five times higher than their proportion of
the population as a whole. Almost a fifth of fallen soldiers came from
kibbutz. Almost every third officer killed in the war was a kibbutz
member." If Israel had a "factory" for passionate dedication to the
new state in its first decades, that factory was the kibbutz. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
In 1909, Tel-Aviv was born. "Tel Aviv" was the title of the Hebrew
translation of Herzl's utopian novel <i>Altneuland</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>tel</i> is a hill created by the remains of homes and buildings of
many generations of people who had lived and rebuilt communities on
the same location.
With time, the level of the hill rises, creating a mound that can be
excavated layer by layer to discover the various stages of life
there. <i>Tel</i> was a reference to the past. <i>Aviv</i> is the Hebrew word
for "spring". Aviv, therefore, captured the Old-New Land to which
Herzl referred in Altneuland.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Whether the children in the village school learn more or less of the
rudiments of elementary grammar… more or less of history, more or
less of science, does not matter. What they have to learn, though, is
this: to be strong and healthy villagers, to be villagers who love
their surroundings and physical work, and most of all to be villagers
who love the Hebrew tongue and the Jewish nation with all their hearts
and souls. 
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 4 - From a Dream to glimmers of Reality)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
In 1931 a group of fighters deeply influenced by Jabotinsky broke away
from the Haganah, creating their own fighting faction. [The Irgun was
born.]
</p>

<p>
Irgun was also known as the Etzel, which is an acronym for the Hebrew
words <i>Irgun Tzva'i Leumi</i>.
</p>

<p>
Initially, most of its fighters were members of Jabotinsky's
Revisionist movement or Betar; Jobotinsky, in fact, was the group's
supreme commander, a figurehead position since the British had exiled
him from Palestine. He retained that title until his death in 1940.
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 5 - The Balfour Declaration)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Note about Chaim Arlosoroff]
</p>

<p>
In June 1933, after having risen to the top of the Yishuv-s
leadership, Arlosoroff returned to Germany to negotiate with German
officials. His mission in Germany was to advance a clan called the
Ha'avarah ("Transfer Agreement") that would allow German Jews to leave
Germany without having to forfeit all their assets.
Jews emigrating from Germany would deposit their money in a fund that
was made available to Palestinian banks. Those banks would then
purchase German goods that were shipped to Palestine. In Palestine,
merchants would purchase the goods, and the money from the purchase
would then be returned to the Jews who had emigrated from Germany.
</p>

<p>
Jabotinsky railed against the Transfer Agreement; he thought it was
a foolhardy attempt to undermine Germany's economic isolation.
[…]
Chaim Arlosoroff and his wife, Sima, went for a stroll on the Tel-aviv
beach. Out of the dark, two men approached, one shining a flashlight
in Arlosoroff's face while the other pulled a gun and fired."
</p>

<p>
(Chapter 6 - Nowhere to go, Even if they could Leave)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The political activist (Arlosoroff), the poet (Bialik) and the
philosopher (Ahad Ha'am) lay side by side - a fitting image of
Zionism's deep intellectual roots and many different voices, and also,
of the ability of those many streams to come together at critical
moments.

Note the striking fact, that such thoughts were written when he was
17 or something like that. You can understand the caliber of the
person by it. I was one of that people at this age. The thing is
that I was scared at this time. I was not really believing 100% in
myself and I was lacking purpose. Make sure that you will not have
your children enter this state of mind.

everything depends on you - on your state of mind, on your successes

You have to try to find the positive of the service, in the army as

command resting on my shoulders.

<p>
On me, on us, the young men of Israel, rests the duty of keeping our

As regards the latest incidents, I really must praise the Jewish
people of Israel. The cool-headedness, the lack of hysteria, the

should ever lose them, your sense of loss will be unbearable, and I,
who love you so, will grieve with you.

I don't regret the crossroads I've passed. Once past the crossing,
I'm on my own way. And if there is more beauty, more flowers along
the road I didn't take, I still don't regret it, because it wasn't
my road. My path will pass through fertile fields and lovely
gardens, and over mountains and rocks and even deserts, but in all
its twists it will be one path - known and yet mysterious. Our life
is a world unto itself within many others. -
for the roads are numberless. Some intersect while others pass
through planes that will never touch. And all the roads are traveled
by people, and sometimes they meet at the crossroads, and sometimes
continue together, and sometimes part again and sometimes not. And
it isn't just a matter of direction but of time as well. And why be
so interested in other planes when we can hardly master our own?

<blockquote>
<p>
Dopo aver mostrato che l’uomo può costruire una casa, una città, ci
mostra che può aver bisogno di cercare la pace in campagna, dove la
pace esiste perché usciamo dal mondo che noi stessi abbiamo costruito:
un mondo fatto di case, di chiese e di piazze; un mondo costruito
dall’uomo e costruito” perchè non ci si vive più così per vivere, come
le piante, senza saper di vivere; bensì per qualche cosa che non c’è e
che vi mettiamo noi; per qualche cosa che dia senso e valore alla
vita; un senso, un valore che qua, almeno in parte, riuscite a
perdere, o di cui riconoscete l’affliggente vanità.” Moscarda sembra
desiderare di non aver più coscienza d’esser, come una pietra, come
una pianta!  L’uomo sa come si forma una nuvola che ignora la sua
esistenza ed è sola; ma sa l’uomo spiegare il perchè dei perchè?
Moscarda ricorda la fatica dell’ uomo; la sua pochezza di fronte
l’infinito; ricorda la vanità dei nostri affanni e mostra il contrasto
tra il volo di un semplice uccellino, che vola con ” un frullo e un
trillo” e quello dell’uomo che si alza da terra con un ” motore
strepitoso e puzzolente e la morte avanti.” Il nostro protagonista
alza la sua invettiva contro il mondo finto e meccanico” un altro
mondo nel mondo” , un mondo che ha senso e valore soltanto per l’uomo
che ne è l’artefice: Pirandello ci indica che la caduta dei valori del
suo tempo può portare alla pazzia; può portare al vaneggiare di
Moscarda che immagina di rientrare dalla campagna, camminando lungo il
Corso di Porta Vecchia, dove gli alberi, ” probabilmente”, non pensano
e le bestie non ragionano. Se potessero pensare… Chissà cosa
penserebbero degli uomini che, per godere della loro ombra, li
piantano in città. Forse… Che cosa stavano a fare lì, in mezzo a tanta
gente affaccendata! Orecchie non ne hanno, ma, forse, per crescere
hanno bisogno di silenzio, quel silenzio che c’è nella Piazzetta
dell’Olivelli, ove la terra ogni anno ne approfitta, perché crede che
lì non ci sia la città e che gli uomini se ne siano andati. Quindi,
l’erba cresce, ma per poco perchè lì, invece, è ancora città per cui
giungono gli spazzini a tagliarla, con grande meraviglia degli
uccellini che si chiedono la ragione della presenza di quegli spazzini
e scappano; non lo possono fare, invece, le bestie che tirano il carro
e, forse, tutte le creature, diverse dall’uomo, hanno un senso per sè
che l’uomo non può intendere: ci sarebbe bisogno di una maggiore
intesa tra l’ uomo e le altre creature che sembra si divertano a
mandare all’aria tutte le costruzioni umane con cicloni e
terremoti. Tuttavia, l’uomo ricostruisce, obbedendo a qualcosa,” che
non si sa cosa sia”, e trasforma la materia a modo suo, considerando
materia anche se stesso: perciò si ricostruisce come ricostruisce la
casa ed ognuno si ricostruisce in una forma che gli altri non gli
riconoscono, come ciascuno di noi non riconosce la forma con cui si
ricostruiscono gli altri; ” e la stessa cosa non è uguale per tuttie
anche per ciascuno di noi che può di continuo cangiare, e difatti
cangia di continuo e l’unica realtà è la forma momentanea che
riusciamo a dare a noi stessi, agli altri e alle cose:”la realtà di
tutti diventa quella che gli altri ci danno, ma si tratta di una
realtà valida per gli altri, non per noi: e ciò varrebbe per
tutti. Gli uomini si costruiscono come costruiscono le case, finché
dura la nostra volontà e i nostri sentimenti; quando volontà e
sentimenti vengono a mancare, ci accorgiamo delle nostre illusioni.
