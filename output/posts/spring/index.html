So this is the next piece of the cake. As we transition to the cloud
it makes sense to have the spring-framework in your skillset.

<p>
The notes are based on Spring in Action - 5th edition.
</p>

<p>
I must say that is not too far from the way I used to develop in
Python. Of course you have some Java-based falvour here and
there. Sometimes with pros sometimes with cons. There are things were
I still believe that Python is clearly superior. So ultimately my goal
is to go in a direction of microservices with reactive architectures
mixing the best of breed.
</p>

<p>
Anyways here and there I skipped some sections. Will go back to them
later when the work will require it.
</p>

<p>
Note that as per my usual way of working I read, make notes, such that
when I work many things should be already familiar and you should have
a high-level understanding of an application written through such
framework.
</p>

<p>
Then of course experience is the one where you fix/crystallize all of
these concepts. That comes with time nothing to add.
</p>

<p>
Creative will then make you deviate from the general structure you
learned.
</p>

<p>
You just have to be careful to document everything then as it should
always be possible for an external to join and take over your work.
</p>

<p>
This is the bit I learned from my current recent experience.

<div id="outline-container-orgc9b1573" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc9b1573">General Idea</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc9b1573">
<p>
At its core, Spring offers a container, often referred to as the
Spring application context, that creates and manages application
components.
</p>

<p>
These components, or beans, are wired together inside the Spring
application context to make a complete application, much like
bricks, mortar, timber, nails, plumbing, and wiring are bound
together to make a house.
</p>

<p>
The act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern known as
<i>dependency injection</i> (DI).
</p>

<p>
Rather than have components create and maintain the lifecycle of
other beans that they depend on, a <i>dependency-injected
application</i> relies on a <b>separate entity (the container)</b> to
create and maintain all components and inject those into the beans
that need them. This is done typically through constructor
arguments or property accessor methods.
</p>

<p>
On top of its core container, Spring and a full portfolio of
related libraries offer a web framework, a variety of data
persistence options, a security framework, integration with other
systems, runtime monitoring, microservice support, a reactive
programming model, and many other features necessary for modern
application development.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org18ceeb4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org18ceeb4">Spring Project Structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18ceeb4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>TacoCloudApplication.java</code> - This is the Spring Boot main class
that bootstraps the project.</li>

<li>
<code>application.properties</code> - here you can specify the configuration
properties.</li>

<li>
<code>static</code> - here you save your static files for your application.</li>

<li>
<code>templates</code> - here you have template files that will be used to
render content to the browser.</li>

<li>
<code>TacoApplicationTests.java</code> - this is a simple test class that
ensures that the Spring application context loads successfully.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgf33f760" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf33f760">Gradle Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf33f760">
<p>
Note that one of the most important thing that you have in your
build configuration is that you deploy to a <code>jar</code> not into a <code>war</code>.
</p>

<p>
Whereas WAR files are perfectly suitable for deploying to a
traditional Java application server, theyâ€™re not a natural fit for
most cloud platforms.
</p>

<p>
Although some cloud platforms (such as Cloud Foundry) are capable of
deploying and running WAR files, <b>all Java cloud platforms are
capable of running an executable JAR file</b>. Therefore, the Spring
Initializer defaults to JAR packaging unless you tell it to do
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Basically you can then set up your project with the required
dependecies. In order to do that, always work through
<a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is useful as through it you can get your skeleton for working
with Spring and through it you can quickly jump-start into your
projects.
</p>

<p>
Note that through <i>transitive dependencies</i> you will manage to keep
your build tools lean. This in the sense that by simply specifying
the follwoing dependecies:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</li>

<li>spring-boot-starter-web</li>
</ul>
<p>
You get out of the box dependencies that makes the following
available:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Springâ€™s MVC framework</li>

<li>Embedded Tomcat</li>

<li>Thymeleaf and the Thymeleaf layout dialect</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moreover, you get autoconfiguration libraries that automatically:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Configure the beans in the Spring application context to enable Spring MVC</li>

<li>Configure the embedded Tomcat server in the Spring application context</li>

<li>Configure a Thymeleaf view resolver for rendering Spring MVC
views with Thymeleaf templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that Thymeleaf is a framework to handle the views. This is
front-end stuff. You did some stuff in there in Python but it is not
your bread and butter and neither your main interest. You are rather
interested in the Spring MVC for writing your endpoints and do the
back-end work.
</p>

<p>
Note as well there is a devtools dependency:
<code>spring-boot-starter-devtools</code>. This is handy when programming as
through it you will be able to have quicker updates and
deployments. It achieves similar results as running flask in
debugging mode. But it adds much more to it. There is also this
H2-console that you need to understand better at some later point.
</p>

<p>
Anyways read more into such devtools when you start properly
developing with it. For now focus on the general structure in these
notes.

							      <span class="c1">// run.</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Through the Spring framework you know that this will be the entry
point for your application and its <code>main</code>.
</p>

<p>
You see that you call then the static <code>run</code> method. This does the
actual bootstrapping of the application, creating the <b>application
context</b> we mentioned before.
</p>

<p>
Note that you pass to the <code>run</code> method:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <b>configuration class</b>
</li>

<li>the <b>command-line arguments</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that in the example above the configuration class is the same
as the <i>bootstrap class</i>. This does not have to be the case.
</p>

<p>
We will see that in fact the larger the projects - the more you
usually work with separate classes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae391f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgae391f3">MVC - through it you write your back-end endpoints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgae391f3">
<p>
This is a web-framework. Again check the more detail section <a href="#org5259c03">Web-applications with Spring</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the center of it there is the concept of <i>controller</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is a class that handles requests and responds with
information. I.e. it is the class through which you classically
implement your endpoints.
</p>

<p>
So in order to implement the most basic endpoint you can work as
follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nn">myCoolPackage</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.stereotype.Controller</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="nd">@Controller</span> 
   <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HomeController</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nd">@GetMapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">home</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"home"</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Note that the <code>@Controller</code> annotation doesn't do much. It is there
to identify the class as a component. This will be useful as you
will do some component-scanning in your Spring-application context
then.
</p>

<p>
I.e. through the annotation Springâ€™s component scanning
automatically discovers it and creates an instance of
Home-Controller as a bean in the Spring application context.
</p>

<p>
The <code>@GetMapping</code> is there to note that the endpoint will work with
GET requests. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbe7246a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbe7246a">Endpoints Testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe7246a">
<p>
You can check in the book. This will be a quite big waste of time
nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Start first by deciding on which tests suite you want to use. All
of these books explain you the stuff pretending there would be just
a single way of doing it.
</p>

<p>
This is not the case. So get the general structure and idea. But do
not spend too much time on it now on doing documentation. You might
use then a complete different testing-suite.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org70d928f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org70d928f">Important Spring Modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org70d928f">
<p>
Note that on that spring initialzer page you can see all of the
dependencies nicely integrated with the spring framework.
</p>

<p>
You can navigate it in detail in time.
</p>

<p>
However, in general there are macroscopic classes, that you need to
understand:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc660219" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc660219">Core Spring Framework</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc660219">
<p>
This is the fundation of everything in the spring universe.
</p>

<p>
It provides the core container and dependencies injection
framework.
</p>

<p>
It also provides the following essential features:m
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spring MVC</li>

<li>Template based JDBC support</li>

<li>Spring WebFlux (for <b>reactive</b> programming)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9890a77" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9890a77">Spring Boot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9890a77">
<p>
This is what makes autoconfiguration and starter-depencies
possible.
</p>

<p>
Note that the starter-dependencies are exactly the thing we
mentioned. I.e. you specified these very general
<code>spring-boot-starter-xxx</code> dependencies and through it you get a ton
of others transitive dependencies and autoconfigurations of them.
</p>

<p>
Note that Spring Boot also allows the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <b>Actuator</b> provides runtime insight into the inner workings of
an application, including metrics, thread dump information,
application health, and environment properties available to the
application.</li>

<li>Flexible specification of environment properties.</li>

<li>Additional testing support on top of the testing assistance found
in the core framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Spring Boot offers an alternative programming model based on Groovy
scripts thatâ€™s called the Spring Boot CLI (command-line
interface). With the Spring Boot CLI, you can write entire
applications as a collection of Groovy scripts and run them from
the command line.
</p>

<p>
Not interesting to me. It is another layer of config. It seems that
this Groovy is quite some config language in the Java world as it
is used for both specifying things in Gradle as well as here in
Spring at macro-level.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb692767" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb692767">Spring Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb692767">
<p>
Whatâ€™s more, Spring Data is capable of working with a <i>several
different kinds of databases</i>, including relational (JPA), document
(Mongo), graph (Neo4j), and others.
</p>

<p>
So interesting altough as mentioned I do not like to work with such
interfaces as then you stick too much into a single language.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to work with the native declarative languages of each as
these are quite stable and will provide the necessary portability
across languages.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbf2f0f5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbf2f0f5">Spring Security</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf2f0f5">
<p>
Through it you can manage a broad range of application security
needs, including authentication, authorization, and API security.
</p>

<p>
This is what you did in your last Flask project. So similar
thing. Was never a fun of it. I hope I will not have to dig too
much into it. However, with the Zero-trust Architecture paradigm I
might have to do that at some point. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd52a5a5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd52a5a5">Spring Integration and Spring Batch</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd52a5a5">
<p>
<b>Spring Integration</b>: addresses real-time integration where data is
processed as itâ€™s made available.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spring Batch</b>: addresses batched integration where data is allowed
to collect for a time until some trigger (perhaps a time trigger)
signals that itâ€™s time for the batch of data to be processed.
</p>

<p>
So this will be important as with it you can push the boundaries
of your market risk system and make a nice machine out of it. It
will be very important in this sense to master functional
programming and these frameworks in order to have a proper baby.

<div id="outline-container-orgddfc73e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgddfc73e">Spring Cloud</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgddfc73e">
<p>
Microservices are a hot topic, addressing several practical
development and runtime concerns. In doing so, however, they bring
to fore their own challenges. Those challenges are met head-on by
Spring Cloud, a collection of projects for developing cloud-native
applications with Spring.
</p>

<p>
So that is interesting and what Sergio was mentioning. I am
interested in looking into it as many things were provided by
external dashboards on the cloud from my experience at IBM.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in this sense to understand how that is working
and how exactly is it monitoring things given that the things work
in different runtimes.

<div id="outline-container-org4120600" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4120600">Configuring Spring</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4120600">
<p>
So basically Spring it is nice cause you have tons of beans in
spring that will ultimately be injected in your context and you will
have a well rounded Java development environment.
</p>

<p>
So this is basically the idea. You differentiate two components in
Java:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<i>Bean wiring</i>: through this component you can define the beans
that you will use in your spring application. I.e. the beans that
will be discoverable from the spring context. Moreover, through
<i>beans wiring</i> you specify how the different beans will be
injected into each other.</li>

<li>
<i>Property injection</i>: this sets the values on the different beans
in the Spring context of the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will see how to specify these two fundamental components through
Spring boot. You will then be able to create your modularized
application and work with it in a smooth and agile way.

I.e. what you do is to instantiate the spring application by
setting all of the relevant parameters that will be used in order
to instantiate the relevant beans with the relevant configurations.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you specify the spring configuration you want by specifying
the relevant paramters through cmd line, yaml configuration files
etc.
</p>

<p>
Spring boot will then refer to the relevant configuration available
in the <i>spring environment</i> to initiate the relevant beans and make
them accessible by the proper injection into the spring context.
</p>

<p>
So given the general picture above understand the following
components that are key to every proper Spring application and that
you should accordingly set.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5ca0056" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5ca0056">Embedded Server</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ca0056">
<p>
Here you can decide where your embedded server will communicate.
</p>

<p>
The default embedded server is Tomcat. You can change the option
and work with different servers.
</p>

<p>
In order to do so set the following in the the <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code>
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   server:
    port: 0
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that port <code>0</code> is a sensible choice as you will be able in such
a way to do proper integration testing. You do not hard-wire a port
but each time a different port is selected.
</p>

<p>
You will therefore make sure that your tests do not simply pass
because a port was hard-wired.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is a good point but it can well be a moot
point. Everything ultimately depends on the infrastructure
initialization.
</p>

<p>
Here you can also specify all of the options for ssl, your
key-stores etc. I just note it here but again I do not think I will
never need that stuff as we are in the era of the cloud and I think
it is a sensible decision to leverage the abstraction layer in
there.
</p>

<p>
Note taht this is likely the way I will choose. Write tha
<code>application.yml</code> with all of the desired properties you would like
to set. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org222b82f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org222b82f">Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org222b82f">
<p>
Here you can specify the driver and the location of the DB you will
interact with.
</p>

<p>
You have to understand how this overlaps with Gradle. There you
specify as well parts of this.
</p>

<p>
So double check how these two fits together. I am quite sure that
if you work with spring you do not specify the stuff in
gradle. I.e. you just specify the spring dependencies in gradle.
</p>

<p>
Then once this is specified it is all of a game within spring. This
is the big difference. While when programming without Spring you
have to pull the modules one-by-one into gradle and you compose
everything yourself.
</p>

<p>
Moreover as there is not a framework putting everything in an
opinionated context you have to do the manual config yourself.
</p>

<p>
I mean in the notes above I put a bit of notes that are nose-driven
so I am not sure everything is correct at 100% but more or less it
should be that.
</p>

<p>
You can then see in the book how to properly instantiate your db
with the different tables schema etc. I refer to the book in case
you want to go down that road. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc80e3db" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc80e3db">Logging</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc80e3db">
<p>
This is nice, you can set there the standard output of your
logger.
</p>

<p>
Refer to the book. But basically there is an option to do that via
a xml file.
</p>

<p>
Moreover on the top of it once you defined the output of the logger
you can define all of the different levels that should be printed
by the logger.
</p>

<p>
You can that through the standards yaml configuration files.
</p>

<p>
So basically double check the book to see the way to configure your
logging across your applications. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4de49f4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4de49f4">Property injection via special property values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4de49f4">
<p>
This is a nice way to make dynamic and intelligent properties
injection into your spring environment - and consequently beans -.
</p>

<p>
The standard format would be something like that:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   greeting:
    welcome: You are using ${spring.application.name}
</pre></div>

<p>
i.e. you map <code>greeting.welcome</code> to "You are using
\({spring.application.name}", where =\){spring.application.name}=
maps to the <code>spring.application.name</code> of the yaml.
</p>

<p>
I think that essentially and ultimately it is simple yaml syntax.
</p>

<p>
What is important to get is how this properties are injected into
spring. This is a different story.
</p>

<p>
This is what is actully handeled in the next section.   
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge57e214" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge57e214">Creating your own configuration properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge57e214">
<p>
Configuration properties are nothing more than properties of beans
that have been designated to accept configurations from Springâ€™s
environment abstraction.
</p>

<p>
So the above configurations are easy to integrate.
</p>

<p>
This is the <b>important</b> section. We will see how the beans are
actually designed to consume the configuration in the spring
environment and how you can actually set up your configuration and
inject it into the beans.
</p>

<p>
In order to do that you have to understand a couple of flags as in
the usual case of spring - i.e. these are actually the first class
citizens of spring through which you can manage it all.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, one of the most important annotation is the
following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>@ConfigurationProperties annotation. When placed on any Spring
bean, it specifies that the properties of that bean can be
injected from properties in the Spring environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is then immediate to understand the logic. You can check at it
in the book and online but you get the essential idea of beans and
property injection and how that works.
</p>

<p>
So basically the idea is the following - take the example of
setting the page-size in the front-end displaying a given number of
taco orders - this is the example of the book of reference.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nd">@Controller</span> <span class="c1">// recall controller is the way you denote the class</span>

       <span class="p">}</span>

   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In such a way you can then set the properties in your application
<code>yaml</code> - for instance the default page size in your controller:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   taco:
    orders:
    pageSize: 10
</pre></div>

<p>
Spring framework will then take care of property injection as
described.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd3d7ddf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd3d7ddf">
<b>Important Design Point</b> - Note that usually you set configproperties to <b>component classes</b>
</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd3d7ddf">
<p>
So basically recall that component is a first class citizen in the
Spring framework and these can then be picked up by the Spring
context and injected into other classes.
</p>

<p>
So basically what you do in Spring is creating a couple of these
<i>components</i> that will be holding some given properties that you
can instantiate via your defined <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can then inject these components across the application into
the different controllers etc.
</p>

<p>
This will keep your application modular and will make it possible
for you to have a solid design. You also understand that when
refactoring you just change values at one spot and everything will
adjust as it will be referencing that given component through
property injection.
</p>

<p>
I.e. the example above
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nn">tacos.web</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.boot.context.properties.</span>
	<span class="n">ConfigurationProperties</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.stereotype.Component</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">lombok.Data</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="nd">@Component</span>
    <span class="nd">@ConfigurationProperties</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"taco.orders"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nd">@Data</span> <span class="c1">// lombok will implement getters and setters.</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">OrderProps</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">pageSize</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then you would inject that component in the controller - see the
difference with the above - more ordered OrderController, more
modular, reusable Component -.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nd">@Controller</span>
    <span class="nd">@RequestMapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/orders"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h3 id="orgd95bad2">Excurs - Validation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd95bad2">
<p>
Note that it makes sense to use <code>javax.validation.*</code> in combination
with your spring application properties.
</p>

<p>
With it you can double check some variables etc.
</p>

<p>
This might be especially useful to apply to your <code>Components</code>. Then
the idea is that you write your componnents, you instantiate them

you inject them in your application.

<div id="outline-container-org1b08102" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1b08102">Profiles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b08102">
<p>
This is an important concept when configuring your spring
application.
</p>

<p>
Profiles allow you to create <b>conditional configuration</b>
properties.
</p>

<p>
I.e. framed as per the book:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Profiles are a type of <i>conditional configuration</i> where different
beans, configuration classes, and configuration properties are applied
or ignored <i>based on what profiles are active</i> at runtime.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So how do you use such conditional properties? The idea is to
create multiple <code>yaml</code> files where you will store different bits of
information.
</p>

<p>
The name of the file <b>should follow this convention</b>:
<code>application-{profile name}.yml</code> <b>or</b> <code>application-{profile
   name}.properties</code>.
</p>

<p>
The idea is then the following. You can activate profiles as
described in <a href="#org0932eb5">Activating Profiles</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is your choice of design. Note that there are as
well other ways to configure profiles - i.e. you set everything in
your <code>application.yml</code> file with the following syntax:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   logging:
     level:
       tacos: DEBUG

   # note tree lines to separate profiles. all below belongs to the
   # prod profile.
   ---  

   # specify name of the profile
   spring:
     profiles: prod  

     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/tacocloud
       username: tacouser
       password: tacopassword
       logging:

     level:
       tacos: WARN
</pre></div>


<p>
The basic idea is the following - the first section is the default
section. The properties of the second section are just active when
the profile is active.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0932eb5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0932eb5">Activating Profiles</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0932eb5">
<p>
Now you understand how to set the properties for different
profiles. The question is then how you active the different
profiles.
</p>

<p>
This is again done by configuring the <code>spring.profiles.active</code>
property with the desired profiles to be activated when launching
the applicaiton.
</p>

<p>
As always you can set the property in the <code>application.yml</code> or by
passing it via command line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
</pre></div>

<p>
Or the second option:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    spring:
     profiles:
       active:
       - prod
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3 id="orgaaf583e">Profile-dependent Beans</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaaf583e">
<p>
Note now that it is as well possible to create beans that will just
be active depending on the profile.
</p>

<p>
You can well understand the usage of them.
</p>

<p>
There are simple annotations for it.

<p>
With it you can both display information to the front-end in a
dynamic way.
</p>

<p>
Or, alternatively, it will be possible for you to develop REST
endpoints with it.
</p>

<p>
I will not make big notes of the first. It is not my bread and
butter. Note that it is pretty much what you saw at the times of
your IBM projects when you worked with flask.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you serve the static content via MVC, and you have different
<code>views</code>, through which it is possible to embedd the application
logic into the front-end.
</p>

<p>
The book worked with Thymeleaf as a view framework in order to
embedd the application logic into the front-end. We work with
Mustache. Though, you can imagine that the two are quite similar -
and again, from what you can read this is exactly what you could
see when working on your flask-login module. 
</p>

<p>
Note that in general you always talk with the controller when
instatiating the HTTP request. Then you perform your application
logic and pass on the relevant info to the views.
</p>

<p>
Note that you set up all of this <code>MVC</code> architecture and framework
through <code>@Controller</code>. This will handle requests and will trigger
and respond with views etc. In any case it is the <i>controller</i>
piece of the <code>MVC</code> architecture you can read about <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-classical-architectures/">classical
architectures</a>.

<div id="outline-container-org3bebe0b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3bebe0b">On important Annotations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bebe0b">
<p>
So understand the following annotations in order to properly set up
your application:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
<code>@RestController</code>:
</p>

<p>
Note that this is an annotation like @Controller and @Service
that marks a class for discovery by component scanning.
</p>

<p>
However, note the following <b>important difference</b> to the
general <code>@Controller</code> which might return <i>a view</i> :
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the <code>@RestController</code> all handler methods in the controller should
have their return value written directly to the body of the response,
rather than being carried in the model to a view for rendering. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, you could have annotated DesignTacoController with
@Controller, just like with any Spring MVC controller. But then
youâ€™d need to also annotate all of the handler methods with
@ResponseBody to achieve the same result. So basic point: <i>see
how IT architecture is modular</i>. You can compose it yourself or
use abstraction. For me the choice is no matter of big questions.
</p>

<p>
So the difference is that one specific controller for <code>REST</code>
endpoints. Use that.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<code>@RequestMapping</code>
</p>

<p>
Use it as follows:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>     <span class="nd">@RestController</span>
     <span class="nd">@RequestMapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"/design"</span><span class="p">,</span> 
      <span class="n">produces</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"application/json"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// multiple formats are also possible: produces={"application/json", "text/xml"})</span>
      <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">myClassHandlingEndpoints</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	 <span class="p">...</span>
	 <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then basically in this way you are saying that all of the
handlers in the class will handle requests to endpoints with
basis <code>/design</code>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover you say that you will return <code>json</code> as it is often the
norm.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<code>@GetMapping</code>
</p>

<p>
Note that this is the way you handle get requests in your
<code>@RestController</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the path you specify in such annotations augments the
one from the base-mapping in the class-level <code>@RequestMapping</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that we make an example with a <i>placeholer</i>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>     <span class="nd">@GetMapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/{id}"</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Taco</span> <span class="nf">tacoById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nd">@PathVariable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"id"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">Long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// see pathvariable here. this is the value in the request.</span>
	 <span class="n">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Taco</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">optTaco</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tacoRepo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">findById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span>
	 <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">optTaco</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">isPresent</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">optTaco</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="p">();</span>
	 <span class="p">}</span>
	 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span>
     <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<code>@RequestStatus</code>
</p>

<p>
That is nice cause with that tag you can specify what the
endpoint will utlimately hand back as HTTP anser.
</p>

<p>
Check online at all of the options you have in this sense.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<code>@RequestBody</code>
</p>

<p>
This is important when handling post requests.
</p>

<p>
Simply put, the <code>@RequestBody</code> annotation maps the HttpRequest
body to a transfer or domain object, enabling automatic
<i>deserialization</i> of the inbound HttpRequest body onto a <i>Java
object</i>. Spring automatically deserializes the JSON into a Java
type, assuming an appropriate one is specified.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-request-response-body">this</a> for more. So you see this is how you handle json
requests in a straightforward way without having to do all of
that big conversion in the way we are doing.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgf577dbd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf577dbd">HETOAS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf577dbd">
<p>
Note that if you want you can work with <i>Hypermedia as the Engine
of Application State</i> as a standard for setting up your REST
endpoints.
</p>

<p>
You can read the idea <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think the idea is nice. The idea is that you can give back some
endpoints in your responses such that you can then programatically
trigger some endpoints in a programmatic way without hard-coding
them.
</p>

<p>
The entire application is then more bounded to the code itself and
less on hard-coded strings.
</p>

<p>
Read again in the book if you want to go in that direction.

<div id="outline-container-org7980762" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7980762">Spring Data REST</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7980762">
<p>
Basically here the concept is the following.
</p>

<p>
If you include the <code>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</code> dependency in
your configuration and you work with Spring Data, then Spring will
create out of the box endpoints for your Spring Data JPA
repositories and will even expose endpoints following <code>HETOAS</code>
convention as mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
So note how you should work with JPA if you want to work with
Spring Data REST.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise if you want to work with pure SQL you will have to
manually set up the endpoints yourself as discussed in the previous
sections.
</p>

<p>
So this is a design choice you will have to face soonish. The point
remains open to this stage.
</p>

<p>
I think the question is if you want to stay generally in the same
environment or not.

<p>
If you will ever decide to go down that road read chapter <i>6.3.1 -

<h3 id="org8407675">Consuming REST services</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8407675">
<p>
There are essentially three ways of consuming a REST interface:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<code>RestTemplate</code>: this is a synchronous REST client provided by the
Spring Framework.</li>

<li>
<code>Traverson</code>: a hyperlink-aware synchronous REST client provided
by Spring HATEOAS. See more on hyperlink <a href="#orgf577dbd">here</a>.</li>

<li>
<code>WebClient</code>: a <b>reactive</b> asynchronous REST client.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3c073fe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3c073fe">RestTemplate</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3c073fe">
<p>
basically RestTemplate provides 41 methods for interacting with
REST resources.
</p>

<p>
You can then surf around in the internet in order to see the
different methods.
</p>

<p>
What you should take away is the following basic structure:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instantiate the RestTemplate</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can do that either by instantiating an instance for it as
usual or by creating a <code>Bean</code> and injecting it around the
application.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">RestTemplate</span> <span class="n">rest</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">RestTemplate</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
undestand this difference as it is core to the Spring-native way
of working.
</p>

<p>
Then that is basically it. You have then your methods you work
with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="c1">// just one short example, then the basic structure is equal</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="nf">getIngredientById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ingredientId</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">rest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">getForObject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"http://localhost:8080/ingredients/{id}"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">// endpoint to be consumed</span>
     <span class="n">Ingredient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ingredientId</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// second argument object you want</span>

				       <span class="c1">// third argument -&gt; paramter for the url.</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that this is a bit the idea. There are better methods then.
In this way it will be possible to work in a more structured
way. Check at the method involving maps in this sense.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea stays. You can consume your endpoints in such way,
passing parameters and deserializing the response to Java native
Objects.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org08a3aa4">
<p>
Basically this is similar to the simple RestTemplate and it is the
way to cconsume hypermedia APIs.
</p>

<p>
I leave this section for now as I am still not sure I will work
with HATEOAS.
</p>

<p>
Recall in any case that once you have hypermedia APIs you consume
API by traversing multiple API based on the response.

<p>
i.e. this is how you annotate the different things in your API.
</p>

<p>
You can then properly expose them.
</p>

<p>
Note that I am having some minor troubles to set it up properly.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga970934">
<p>
So we will treat here how to interact with JDBC and JPA in Spring.
</p>

<p>
Note that the difference between the two is the level of
abstraction. Through JDBC you communicate directly with the DB by
passing SQL queries and interacting with the driver of the DB.
</p>

<p>
JPA is the higher level of abstraction. There you can work with the
first-class citzens of java: objects. Check your other post where
you digged a little bit more deeper into them.
</p>

<p>
Note that these notes are just approximate. You make sense of the
java way of developing in here. Note that you should then just refer
to these to get the gist of the idea when creating your first
restful service with data persistence.
</p>

<p>
You should then create the most logical and classical way for
persistence using the following repository holding the code for the
application in a unified way: <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/tree/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/java/tacos">here</a>.

<h3 id="orgd3e9d9a">Spring JDBC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3e9d9a">
<p>
Spring JDBC support is rooted in the JdbcTemplate class.
</p>

<p>
JdbcTemplate provides a means by which developers can perform SQL
operations against a relational database without all the ceremony and
boilerplate typically required when working with JDBC.
</p>

<p>
So basically with jdbc you do not have to handle all of the
connections and the error messages explicitely. So the module in Java
helps you to work without all of the boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
I like this code as it is more lean than without the templates.

You would do that in the follwoing way leveraging on the JDBC templates
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="c1">// Note how you focus on the query in here. No connection is handeled. </span>
 <span class="nd">@Override</span>

 <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Note that the <code>queryForObject</code> above maps the query to a single
object.
</p>

<p>
If you want to map each row of the query to an object which you then
would save in a <b>Collection</b> you can use the <code>query</code> method. Check
the below in this sense:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="nd">@Override</span>
 <span class="c1">// note the Collection result here.</span>
 <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Iterable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Ingredient</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">findAll</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

 <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
So basically that is how it works. you just have then to embedd such
methods into a class that is initialized with jdbc template.
</p>

<p>
You can do that as <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/blob/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/java/tacos/data/JdbcIngredientRepository.java">here</a>. Note as well the constructor with
<code>@Autowired</code> there. This is a Spring specific annotation in order to
get things in the context etc. Note as well the installation of
<code>RowMapper</code>. Note that this necessary as the second argument of the
<code>query</code> etc. is in fact a rowmapper and the referenced methods are
interenally treated as such. You can find in the book an example on
how to work explicitely with Rowmapper but this is not in my interest
as it just clutters the code.

<h3 id="org5c334bb">Writing to RDMS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c334bb">
<p>
To write into the RDMS using JDBC template you can use the
<code>update</code> method.
</p>

<p>
You can do that in the follwoing way
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="nd">@Override</span>
   <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="nf">save</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Ingredient</span> <span class="n">ingredient</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Because it isnâ€™t necessary to map ResultSet data to an object, the
<code>update()</code> method is much simpler than <code>query()</code> or
<code>queryForObject()</code>.
</p>

<p>
There is then a messy section about writing the stuff in the DB
when you have to make sure all of the keys relations are
satisfied. I jumped it as it is not well written. In this book you
do not have an overview of what piece of code is written were, so I
thought I will understand at the time of getting my hands dirty
with it. So wait for it and tackle this down at a later point.

<p>
Now the question is if you want to do it like that in Java or not.
</p>

<p>
I like the idea as this is plain SQL. So you can keep it in your
project repo. You can moverover generate the schema for localhost
embedded DB as H2 where you can test and work in dev mode.
</p>

<p>
Moreover once everything defined you can run the same sql file to
populate your DB of interest.
</p>

<p>
If you take this approach you just have to make sure that the H2
embedded DB has the same SQL dialect as the server you are using
and make all of these kind of reasoning. 
</p>

<p>
So the question is how do you execute the schema definition above?
</p>

<p>
Again Spring comes at rescue. In the moment where you will save the
stuff in the proper repo and adhere to some basic convention the
file <b>will be executed</b> against the DB when the application
starts.
</p>

<p>
I.e. you should save the file as <code>schema.sql</code> in the
<code>src/main/resources</code> repo.
</p>

<p>
You can find the example fo the book <a href="https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples/tree/master/ch03/tacos-jdbc/src/main/resources">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can as well pre-populate the DB with some records by writing
some insert statements in a <code>data.sql</code> file also saved on the same
repo.

<h3 id="orgf996d4d">Spring JPA</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf996d4d">
<p>
Ok - here there is a big discussion among the Java experts in my
team and other people coming from other programming languages.
</p>

<p>
I still have to understand it properly. Heavy Java users claim it
is the way to work with data in Java. It will allow the developer
to keep thinking and programming in terms of objects.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand it is true that if you work through such layer
you will create a strong dependency to Java. It will not be easy to
migrate to other modern data-driven languages that direct SQL.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance the SQL in the python environment where you can
apply it directly to pandas, apache-spark-sql etc.
</p>

<p>
I also have to understnad better the scope of Spring JPA - and the
extent to which it differs from Hibernate JPA. I think in fact that
Spring JPA leverages by default the Hibernate JPA but would have
eventually to check it up once and if you decided to go through
this JPA experience in the way you develop in Java.

<h2 id="org2f412cd">Spring Integration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2f412cd">
<p>
That is also a nice feature.
</p>

<p>
See the book:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sring Integration is a ready-to-use implementation of many of the
integration patterns that are catalogued in Enterprise Integration
Patterns by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison-Wesley, 2003).
</p>

<p>
Each pattern is implemented as a component through which messages
ferry data in a pipeline, you can assemble these components into a
pipeline through which data flows. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is something that you want to explore. It basically is an
entire suit that will allow you to easily interface with external
systems.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge46f0cf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge46f0cf">FileSystem Integration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge46f0cf">
<p>
The file endpoint module offers the ability to ingest files from
the filesystem into an integration flow and/or to write data from a
flow to the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
This is important and you can start to see how you can work with
it. Think for instance to your feed application. This is what you
will need. 
</p>

<p>
Check for instance the following example
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.integration.annotation.MessagingGateway</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.springframework.integration.file.FileHeaders</span><span class="p">;</span>

			<span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// here is the stuff you write to the file.</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
So you understand that this is much easier in comparison to
starting open Inputstreams and parse line by line.
</p>

<p>
Understand now the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
<code>@MessagingGateway</code>:
</p>

<p>
This annotation tells Spring Integration to generate an
<b>implementation of this interface</b> at runtime.  The others part
of the code will use then this interface when they need to write
a file.
</p>

<p>
Note now that any call to the implementation of the
MessagingGateway, will be sent to the given message channel. In
this case, you state that any messages that result from a call to
writeToFile() should be sent to the channel whose name is
textInChannel.
</p>

<p>
So you understand a bit at high level how the Spring Integration
framework works.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note then that you can start to define how the write should be
performed thorugh different configuration options - say:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>XML configuration</li>
<li>Java configuration</li>
<li>Java configuration with a DSL</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you work with XML one of the typical examples could be the
following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
   &lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	  xmlns:int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration"
	  xmlns:int-file="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/file"
	  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans

			      http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration

			      http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/file
			      http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/file/springintegration-file.xsd"&gt;
     &lt;int:channel id="textInChannel" /&gt; 
     &lt;int:transformer id="upperCase"
		      input-channel="textInChannel"
		      output-channel="fileWriterChannel"
		      expression="payload.toUpperCase()" /&gt; &lt;!-- interesting - it seems that you can enter java here. --&gt;
     &lt;int:channel id="fileWriterChannel" /&gt; 
     &lt;int-file:outbound-channel-adapter id="writer"
					channel="fileWriterChannel"
					directory="/tmp/sia5/files"
					mode="APPEND"
					append-new-line="true" /&gt;    &lt;!-- see here you append and not do it. --&gt;
   &lt;/beans&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
You can then continue reading in the book for the other two
configuration possibilities.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfde426" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdfde426">Integration Components</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdfde426">
<p>
Now note that in a similar way as you have created your file
system integration and write into there, you can create similar
integration patterns around your application.
</p>

<p>
So that is basically it. Understand now that you have the
following lego components through which you can set up your
integration patterns. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
Channels:
</p>

<p>
pass messages from one element to the other. See for instance
the example above.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Filters:
</p>

<p>
contionally allow messages to pass through
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Transformers:
</p>

<p>
change message values. See this is what you have used above in
the xml config file to make everything uppercase.      
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Routers:
</p>

<p>
direct messages to one of several channels.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Splitters:
</p>

<p>
Split incoming messages into two or more messages, each sent to
<b>different channels</b>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Aggregators:
</p>

<p>
The opposite of splitters, <b>combining multiple messages</b> coming in
from separate channels into a single message. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Service Activators:
</p>

<p>
Hand a message off to some Java method for processing, and then
publish the return value on an output channel.
</p>

<p>
<i>nice</i>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Channel Adapters:
</p>

<p>
Connect a channel to some external system or transport. Can
either accept input or write to the external system.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Gateways:
</p>

<p>
pass data to an integration flow via an interface.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that to properly manage Spring integration is a job on its
own. Like all of the major components you came across that far.
</p>

<p>
Leave it on hold for now but note that you have multiple channels,
like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>pubSubscribe</code></li>

<li><code>queues</code></li>

<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Just understand how you inject the stuff in your application here
and there.

<p>
There is even all of the layer about securing the spring application
such that it properly communicate by encrypting data in transfer.
</p>

<p>
You might need it for your next assignment.
</p>

<p>
Keep it in the back of your mind and skip it for the moment and go
back to it when the project will require it.
</p>

<p>
So basically it is all about the key generation and exchange.

<div id="outline-container-orgcaad546" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcaad546">Application Restart</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcaad546">
<p>
Have to integrate at some point the <code>Spring DevTools</code>.
</p>

<p>
With them as part of your project, you will be able to make changes
to Java code and properties files in the project and see those
changes applied after a brief moment.
</p>

<p>
Note that the quintessential idea of setting up this application
restart is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
More precisely, when DevTools is in play, the application is loaded
into two separate class loaders in the Java virtual machine
(JVM).
</p>

<p>
One class loader is loaded with your Java code, property files, and
pretty much anything thatâ€™s in the src/main/ path of the
project. These are items that are likely to change frequently. The
other class loader is loaded with dependency libraries, which arenâ€™t
likely to change as often.  When a change is detected, DevTools
reloads only the class loader containing your project code and
restarts the Spring application context, but leaves the other class
loader and the JVM intact. Although subtle, this strategy affords a
small reduction in the time it takes to start the application.
</p>

<p>
The downside of this strategy is that changes to dependencies wonâ€™t
be available in automatic restarts. Thatâ€™s because the class loader
containing dependency libraries isnâ€™t automatically reloaded. This
means that any time you add, change, or remove a dependency in your
build specification, youâ€™ll need to do a <b>hard restart</b> of the
application for those changes to take effect.
