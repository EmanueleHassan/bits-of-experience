* On some poorly tasting jokes

  So yesterday at work I was addressed with some jokes.

  I was told:

  #+begin_quote
Whatâ€™s worse than having a worm in your apple?

Having half a worm in your apple and the other in your mouth.
  #+end_quote

  There is an [[https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/whats_worse_than_finding_a_worm_in_your_apple_the_holocaust][anti joke]] for it. Poor taste the anti joke,
  giving the story of my broader family.

  Thanks G-d I am alive. Which brings me to the second joke I was
  told.

  We should cherish to be alive. Let's conclude with a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yZVweZ2Cvg][bit of music]].

** Update 01/10/2022

   The truth is that I am scared. I am scared for the health of my
   family. And when you are scared your brain seeks help, it is
   psychological literature. In my case, shelter in religion and
   judaism.

   This is the thing. I am obsessed by judaism by now. I see judaism
   everywhere. I see encrypted judaism messages everywhere. They tell
   you two jokes and you google the meaning and find judaism and the
   story of your anchestors in it.

   I am shifting these posts back in history as I know that jews are
   not welcomed by many people. I partially hide them. Some people
   tell me that you should not be afraid. That companies are bounded
   by law not to discriminate because of religion. I hope that this is
   true.

   After all this is the history of Yisrael. Bounded to fight with
   G-d and survive. Always /Am Yisrael Chai/.
