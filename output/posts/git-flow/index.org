So brief entry on git-flow. 

I am still in the phase where I have to set up my workflow properly,
such that order will reign and that chaos will come to hunt me down in
a couple of months/years. That standard looks promising. It is nothing
too far to what you used to do before. However, it is a framework used
in many enterprises so that it is good to stick to it. 

{{{TEASER_END}}}

Look at here the schema of the flow:

#+begin_export html
 <img src="../../images/Screenshot 2021-10-14 172659.png" class="center">
#+end_export

Should the above not be clear, you can read the entire logic [[https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/][here]].

Recall as well to put the relevant jira-ticket when you commit to the
source.
