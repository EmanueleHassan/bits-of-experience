So I am continuing my trip in the discovery of myself. I am still
learning how to properly run. 

Recent events brought me to think a little bit about the tale of the
/turtle and the hare/.

Fables are what I usually go back to when I have to understand the
world. I think it is brilliant the way human being decided to infuse
tons of wisdom in little stories that are then taught to children in
order to teach them about life. So when I need help to understand the
world I turn into a child and refer back to the fables.

Actually I do not just turn back to fables, I turn as well to Disney
movies to get a bit of pills of wisdom such as: /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08NlhjpVFsU][one]]/, /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoCYwefq1A][two]]/, /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiNy4d4gc][three]]/.

Now turning to the point of this blog and on the /tortoise and the hare/,
on /Achilles and the Tortoise/, on /Festina Lente/.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

So in order to tackle down the idea of this post let's start from the first
element. The one of /tortoise and the hare/.

So basically the message of the first line of reading the story is
simple. It goes a little bit along the lines of the italian phrase:
/chi va piano va sano e va lontano (the one that goes slowly goes safe
and far)/. The idea is that going too fast, and with arrogance as in
the story, will destroy you while going slowly but steadily you can
reach good results. 

So this is the end of the first line of reasoning. For sure a true
message. But it would be a reduction of the problem to stop at the
first interpretation.

In fact, there is more to think about. You can as well not be
paralized by the fear of going too fast or continue moving like a
turtle if you think that you have more speed in your legs.

After all the [[https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2017/10/22/zenos-paradox-the-puzzle-that-keeps-on-giving/#:~:text=No%20matter%20how%20many%20times,%3A%20Wikimedia%20Commons%20(modified).][Zeno's paradox]] of /Achilles and the Tortoise/ is
mathematically wrong. I.e. if the hare runs faster it will eventually
surpass the turtle, no matter the advantage of the turle, after all we
are living in an /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game][Infinite Game]]/ in contrast to the /tortoise and the
hare/ fable.

So the question is not trivial:

#+begin_quote
should you run at maximum speed or should you rather go slowly, safe
and sound?
#+end_quote

So the answer is that, as always, the turth lies in the
middle. Ehh... yeah life always tricks us with non-trivial problems
but after all this is the beauty of it.

In this sense, I think that the concept of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festina_lente][festina lente]]/ is the
winning horse. So internalize the lesson and learn your lesson, in
order to be in a /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festina_lente][festina lente]]/ state of mind, where /there is no
sense of time passing/, you have to be in a place that makes such
mental state possible otherwise you will be driven in one direction or
the other and that will not be fruitful.

In this sense, for the friends in finance, I was once told that it is
not the /beta/ that counts but the /alpha/. Well, I beg to
disagree. If the two are not vaguely aligned, there is no hope of
reaching /festina lente/ and the mental balance and zen state that
comes with it.
