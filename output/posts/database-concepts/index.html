<p>
So in my new job role there is gonna be quite some SQL so here some
notes on some important DB concepts.
</p>

<p>
Time to refresh, since in the last of couple of years your focus was
not on pure SQL.
</p>

<p>
So for that - what could be better than listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GhislainFournysLectures/playlists">good old
Ghislain</a>?
</p>

<p>
I guess that with a couple of recordings you should have a new correct
mental framework in order to fill up your gaps and that will you put
very high to speed on relational part of the things.. This guy works
at a high level but he does it in a good way that I always enjoyed.

<h2 id="orgc809f7f">On the key refresher</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc809f7f">
<p>
Recall the basics of relational databses. Nothing new but alternate
keys. Did not recall that definition.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb10697" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbb10697">Superkey</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb10697">
<p>
A subset of attributes <i>S</i> is a superkey if - there is a functional
dependency among all of the other attributes in one table and the
subset of attributes: <i>S</i>.
</p>

<p>
A functional dependency is when the value of an attribute is fully
determined by another one.
</p>

<p>
Formally:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-02-10%20162823.png" class="center"><p>
i.e. two values of an attribute which is functionally dependent to
another are equal given that the attribute value which they are
dependent to are equal.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc6ef175" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc6ef175">Candidate Key</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc6ef175">
<p>
A minimum Superkey.
</p>

<p>
You should reason in terms of candidate keys for your entire
universe.
</p>

<p>
Meaning it should hold <b>for all of the tables</b> in your DB.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb87c1ae" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb87c1ae">Closure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb87c1ae">
<p>
Take a set of attributes <i>T</i>.
</p>

<p>
Then you can compute the closure of <i>T</i> by listing all of the
attributes that are functionally determined by the set T.
</p>

<p>
Example with notation:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-02-10%20164844.png" class="center">
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2c87b38" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2c87b38">Minimal Basis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2c87b38">
<p>
Is the minimal set <i>R</i> to get to a given closure <i>U</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1ffed6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd1ffed6">Primary Key</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd1ffed6">
<p>
The <b>primary</b> key is the one that specifies the columns that make a
row entry of the table uniquely identifiable.
</p>

<p>
Should be a candidate key.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org12d661e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org12d661e">Foreign Key</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org12d661e">
<p>
A <b>foreign key</b> is a column (or combination of columns) in a table
whose values <i>must match values of a column in some other
table</i>. FOREIGN KEY constraints <i>enforce referential integrity</i>, which
essentially says that if column value A refers to column value B,
then column value B must exist.
</p>

<p>
So say that you have a link between <code>table1.column_a</code> and
<code>table2.column_b</code>. Then if <code>table1.column_a</code> is a foreign key to
<code>table2.column_b</code>, you can just insert <code>table1.column_a</code> if an
existing entry to <code>table2.column_b</code> <i>already exists</i>.
</p>

<p>
In this sense you have this referential integrity and the name
<i>foreign key</i> makes sense. It is a key to some foreign value such
that you can just have an entry for it if the value that is
referenced is existing.
</p>

<p>
You can then see that you can implement some relational logic with
the help of foreign keys. Note that <i>foreign keys</i> <i>can</i> but do not
have to match existing <i>primary keys</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1454008" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1454008">Alternate Key / Secondary Keys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1454008">
<p>
In order to understand alternate key, first define what the
<b>candidate key</b> is.
</p>

<p>
<b>candidate key</b> = a set of attributes (columns) that fullfills all
of the criteria to be a primary key.
</p>

<p>
An alternate key, or secondary key is the key that has not been
selected to be the primary key, but are candidate keys.
</p>

<p>
So basically with them you can as well identify unique entries in
the table.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9358526" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9358526">Primary Foreign Key</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9358526">
<p>
Primary Foreign Key (PFK) - key which acts as primary key in more
than one table which occurs in tables with an <b>identifying
relationship</b><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgc59a4a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc59a4a7">Database Design Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc59a4a7">
<p>
So now that I am starting to design some tables I indeed got back to
the good old  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GhislainFournysLectures/playlists">good old Ghislain</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9495b3b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9495b3b">Boyce-Codd Normal Form</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9495b3b">
<p>
Work in this way when designing your tables:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-02-10%20171016.png" class="center"><p>
Now note the very important bit of it - check at the video and
understand what you are loosing when designing your tables in this
way and what you are getting. Recall the <b>impossibility triangle</b>:
</p>

<div class="container"> 
  <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v=mCIs63sasH4&amp;list=PLs5KPrcFtb0VaveUT-vsBswwl7RWvFeNf&amp;index=22&amp;t=1750s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</div>

<p>
Impossibility triangle:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-02-11%20090858.png" class="center"><p>
So note that with broken dependency we mean that when splitting up a
bigger table in order to follow the Boyce-Codd Normal Form we might
loose functional dependencies in the smaller projected tables.
</p>

<p>
Losslessjoin - means that if you join the smaller tables that are
in Boyce-Codd normal form, then if a record existed in the bigger
table it will also exist after joining the smaller tables. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5e82814" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5e82814">Parent-Child relations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5e82814">
<p>
It’s usually used to specify where one table’s value refers to the
value in another table (usually a primary key of another table). 
</p>

<p>
For example, imagine a news article. This could be represented by a
table called articles and has fields for id, headline, body,
published<sub>date</sub> and author. But instead of placing a name in the
author field, you could instead put the ID value of a user in a
separate table—maybe called authors—that has information on authors
such as id, name, and email. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if you need to update an author’s name, you only need to
do so in the authors (parent) table; because the articles (child)
table only contains the ID of the corresponding author record.
</p>

<p>
So basically this is a basics principle.

<div id="outline-container-org9cd85f5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9cd85f5">Naming conventions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9cd85f5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>IDs should get an <code>_id</code> suffix, and primary keys should be called
$OBJECT<sub>id</sub> (e.g., order<sub>id</sub>, user<sub>id</sub>, subscription<sub>id</sub>,
order<sub>item</sub><sub>name</sub><sub>id</sub>).</li>

<li>Timestamps should get an <code>_at</code> suffix and dates should get an
<code>_date</code> suffix (e.g., ordered<sub>at</sub> or user<sub>creation</sub><sub>date</sub>).</li>

<li>Booleans should begin with <code>is_</code> or <code>has_</code> (e.g., is<sub>canceled</sub> or
has<sub>discounted</sub><sub>item</sub>).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgecf9690" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgecf9690">Materialization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgecf9690">
<p>
By "materialization" I mean (roughly) whether or not a given
relation is created as a table or as a view.
</p>

<p>
If you create the relation <b>as a table</b>, you precompute any
required calculations, which means that your users will see <b>faster
query response times</b>. If you leave the relation as a view, your
users will get more up-to-date data when they query, but response
times will be slower.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgda22a8e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgda22a8e">Grain</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgda22a8e">
<p>
The most important data modeling concept is the grain of a
relation. (I'm using the abstract term "relation" to refer
generically to tables or views.) The grain of the relation defines
what a single row represents in the relation.
</p>

<p>
So basically you are saying what a row is in the DB.
</p>

<p>
You should then call tables as the <i>pluralized version of the
grain</i>.

<div id="outline-container-org900bef4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org900bef4">Relations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org900bef4">
<p>
Understand the following few concepts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
<code>Identifying relations</code> vs. <code>Non-identifying relations</code>:
</p>

<p>
So this is strictly tight to the concept of <i>primary keys</i> and
<i>primary foreign key</i> - see <a href="#orgc809f7f">On the key refresher</a>.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is that for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<p>
for <code>identifying relations</code>
</p>

<p>
you have a primary foreign key relation among the tables. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
for <code>non-identifying relations</code>
</p>

<p>
you have a primary key for each table and the two tables primary
keys are non-related.
</p>

<p>
However when creating the relation, the primary key of one
table usually becomes an entry - foreign key - of the other
table.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is possibly the most important characteristic.
</p>

<p>
However, note that <a href="https://support.quest.com/technical-documents/toad-data-modeler/6.4/user-guide/25#TOPIC-918537">the following</a> holds in general terms. Check at
it in order to properly define relations.

</p>

<p>
Understand that you might have to do it for some databases where no
proper schema was constructed in time.
</p>

<p>
Then you can start organizing the schema.
</p>

<p>
You will have to use it probably sooner or later. No doubt, so
check at it at some point.
</p>

<p>
Note that you have multiple options in here.

This is interesting cause you might well start to check in DDL
into git.

Then you will solve this coordination issue.

<p>
You just have to check in the DDL script every time which is
painful.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it, you might not display the thing as nicely as in
your <code>*.txp</code> file.
</p>

<p>
In order to insert a DDL schema you work as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open a new workspace. Otherwise it would overwrite your
exisiting solution.</li>

<li>Select <code>Update Model from Database</code> option. See the highlighted

Select <code>DDL Script RE</code> (ddl script reverse engineer) as data
source.

<h3 id="org2ed17ad">Indexes and Constraints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ed17ad">
<p>
So the part of indexes you can well understand given your recent
study of the relevant bit.
</p>

<p>
Note that the indexes mentioned are similar to the one mentioned on
the Microsoft SQL Server.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-02-14%20122328.png" class="center"><p>
Note as well the possibility to impose constraints on your DB
tables.
</p>

<p>
That is of first-order importance and in such a way you can set in
the DB the relevant constraints instead of pushing them to the
application layer.
</p>

<p>
In order to implement such constraints the syntax is the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">table_name</span> <span class="p">(</span>
       <span class="p">...,</span>
       <span class="k">CONSTRAINT</span> <span class="k">constraint_name</span> <span class="k">CHECK</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">predicate</span> <span class="p">),</span>
       <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>

   <span class="c1">--------------</span>

    <span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">table_name</span>
       <span class="k">ADD</span> <span class="k">CONSTRAINT</span> <span class="k">constraint_name</span> <span class="k">CHECK</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">predicate</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
As always you can enter such constraints in Toad and you will be
able to preview the relevant SQL query out of it.

<h3 id="orgd2ab804">Table Views</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd2ab804">
<p>
This is a powerful concepts.
</p>

<p>
The wikipedia definition for it is sufficient to get a basic
understanding of what <i>views</i> are:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A view is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the
database users can query just as they would in a persistent database
collection object.
</p>

<p>
This pre-established query command is kept in the database
dictionary.
</p>

<p>
Unlike ordinary base tables in a relational database, a view does
not form part of the physical schema: as a result set, <b>it is a
virtual table computed or collated dynamically</b> <b>from data in the
database when access to that view is requested</b>. Changes applied to
the data in a relevant underlying table are reflected in the data
shown in subsequent invocations of the view
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Views are helpful in the follwoing cases:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>can represent a subset of data. can be used for access
permissions. You expose a <i>view</i> to some user without exposing the
entire database.</li>

<li>views can <b>join</b> and simplify <b>multiple tables</b> into a single
virtual table. (note that though the performance will likely still
suffer from the burden of computing the joins each time one of the
underlying queries changes)</li>

<li>you can hide some complexity using views such that is useful for
some other person of your team to work with.</li>

<li>views just take very little space to store. the DB just contains
the definiton of a view and not a copy of all the data that it
presents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b> that in a similar way to the programming concepts you can
<b>nest</b> views such that you can <i>a view</i> aggregating the information
from multiple views.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note a table is a set:</b> A view is a relational table, and the
relational model defines a table as a set of rows. Since sets are
not ordered — by definition — neither are the rows of a
view. Therefore, an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause in the view definition is
meaningless.

<h4 id="org91fae97">On Updating a view</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org91fae97">
<p>
<b>Very Important Note - on updating a view</b>: note that if you update a
view you will actually update the underlying <b>persisted</b> table.
Such table will be updated such that your view will ultimately
match your update condition.
</p>

<p>
So this is very important. You cannot only work with views for the
projection exercises and informatin retrieval you need.
</p>

<p>
You can as well use the view in a very neat way for writing and
updating into your DBs.
</p>

<p>
Note that in this sense it might make sense to restrict the view
to allow just specific insert operations.
</p>

<p>
Note as well the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If your view is a projection of a subset of attributes from the
underlying table, you will not be able to update the view if the
missing attributes do not accept null values or do not have a default.
</p>

<p>
This because by product such an update would require the attributes to
become nulls and/or fall back to the default values.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Note as well that recursion is not possible in updating a
view. For instance a nested table in the <code>where</code> clause.

If you decide to materialize do not forget then to referesh the
materialized view if you update the underlying table.

The two will not be in sync if you do not refresh.

You should therefore be particularly careful when working with this.

<h3 id="orgee7072e">Stored Procedures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgee7072e">
<p>
So that is probably the big discussion in my larger team.
</p>

<p>
The question is if to keep the business logic into the application
code or into sql-queries.
</p>

<p>
I always embedded my business logic at the application layer
performing the necessary data withdrawl and transformation steps at
the application layer.
</p>

<p>
There is the tendency in my team to use a different approach and to
<i>store the business logic into stored procedures</i>. I am too fresh
into the entire systems of my team to take an informed about the
topic. (Update 11/02 - I see why they do so. Working in languages
as Java for data wrangling is just plain horror)
</p>

<p>
So develop on this and explore the topic further until you can take
an informed position about the topic.
</p>

<p>
Starting with the basic 15 min. research the following picture
emerge.
</p>

<p>
Stored procedures are essentially SQL statements that are saved in
the database <i>data dictionary</i>. You can <b>pass parameters</b> to your
stored procedures. Such parameters will be passed by the client
triggering a stored procedure. It is therefore possible to expose
some business logic in a flexible way through them.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> that they do not have to return a table (set of rows) or a
value as in the case of functions and there is in this sense a
difference between the two. You can for instance perform CRUD
operations via stored procedures.
</p>

<p>
Now the arguments that I am reading around in favour of stored
procedures are the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>
<p>
It can be <b>easily modified</b>: We can easily modify the code inside
the stored procedure without the need to restart or deploying the
application. For example, if the SQL queries are written in the
application and if we need to change the logic, we must change
the code in the application and re-deploy it.
</p>

<p>
That is true for compiled languages and not for scripting
languages. There there is no big difference as I usually develop
keeping a runtime open where I do my on the fly development
running the application logic of interest.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, this sounds like a little benefit to justify the usage
of such stored procedures.
</p>

<p>
—
</p>

<p>
Even for compiled languages the above is crap. See for instance
devtools in Spring. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Reduceded Network Traffic</b>: A major advantage of stored
procedures is that they can run directly within the database
engine. They are in fact <b>stored on the DB</b> and from there the
database engine executes them.
</p>

<p>
In a production system, this typically means that the procedures
run entirely on a specialized database server, which has <i>direct
access to the data being accessed</i>. You just ship your parameters
and that is it. The benefit here is that network communication costs can be
avoided completely. <b>This becomes more important for complex
series of SQL statements</b>.
</p>

<p>
As if you have to traffic all of the SQL results back and
forth, make transformations and then run other queries based on
that you see that you quickly get a huge amount of traffic and
everything becomes messy.
</p>

<p>
<i>My Comment:</i> I do see the argument. I am not sure that it is
really the definitive solution. As you are running SQL statements
theoretically you can ship the very same SQL statement via the
application and you can do that in 1 shot so if you structure
things properly you should be able to keep your network bandwidth
safe. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Centralized business logic</b>: this point follows directly from
the above. To see this consider the follwoing wording above:
</p>

<p>
<i>They are in fact <b>stored on the DB</b> and from there the database
engine executes them.</i>
</p>

<p>
So this means that you have no chance of having a curropted
client-program logic that was not properly managed across your
software development teams. There is a single source of truth for
the business logic and that reside at the database location.
</p>

<p>
<i>My comment:</i> The strongest argument for me. Probably the one and
only that makes really sense and the ultimate reason for stored
procedures.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> I even read the following as advantage.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The database system can ensure data integrity and consistency
with the help of stored procedures.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>My comment:</i> I think that is very important. Would need some more detailed
explaination of how that would be exactly implemented to make
sense of it in a real way.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Delegating access-rights</b>: In many systems, stored procedures can
be granted access rights to the database that users who execute
those procedures do not directly have.</li>

<li>
<b>Performance:</b> Because stored procedure statements are stored
directly in the database, they may remove all or part of the
compiling overhead that is typically needed in situations where
software applications send inline (dynamic) SQL queries to a
database. (However, most database systems implement statement
caches and other methods to avoid repetitively compiling dynamic
SQL statements.) Also, while they avoid some pre-compiled SQL,
statements add to the complexity of creating an optimal execution
plan because not all arguments of the SQL statement are supplied
at compile time. Depending on the specific database
implementation and configuration, <b>mixed performance results will
be seen from stored procedures versus generic queries</b> or user
defined functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that there are important <b>disadvantages</b> as well.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>
<p>
Stored procedure languages are often vendor-specific. Changing
database vendors usually requires rewriting existing stored
procedures.
</p>

<p>
<i>My comment:</i> interesting that they decided to go so heavily on
them. I think that the lock-up must not be extreme otherwise I
would not imagine them to rely so much on them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Changes to stored procedures are harder to keep track of within a
version control system than other code.
</p>

<p>
<i>My comment:</i> This is in fact what the team is complaining
about. There is a single individual that has a good overview of
them and all of the others are masked and if they want to dig
into it is annoying to start reading huge SQL statements that can
be hardly broken apart in which there are parameters embedded.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that it must be a thing in the DB world the one of working with
DBs.
</p>

<p>
I also heard talking about it in databricks sessions about a company
working with them before switching to databricks.

After getting a little bit more on-hands with their system I think
that it is indeed suboptimal to work through such methods.

<p>
I am quite sure I will put such business logic into the

</p>

<p>
Note that probably they worked as well through them in order to
guarantee ACID transactions.

You have as well methods in spring data that can guarantee you
this property.

<p>
In the vertical partition you split by column. In horizontal you
have different tables with the same schema saved over different

<h4 id="org2af99e4">Database Sharding</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2af99e4">
<p>
Basically as mentioned this is <i>horizontal partitioning</i>.
</p>

<p>
Database shards exemplify a shared-nothing architecture. This means
that the shards are autonomous; they don’t share any of the same data
or computing resources.
</p>

<p>
Oftentimes, sharding is implemented at the <b>application level</b>,
meaning that the application includes code that defines which shard
to transmit reads and writes to. However, some database management
systems have sharding capabilities built in, allowing you to
<i>implement sharding directly at the database level</i>.
</p>

<p>
Note the following <b>reasons for sharding</b>:
</p>

<p>
First and foremost you scale out with it. This is essentially the
idea of the Big Data frameworks that you saw in your multiple
classes at University time. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Another reason why some might choose a sharded database architecture
is to <b>speed up query response times</b>. When you submit a query on a
database that hasn’t been sharded, it may have to search every row in
the table you’re querying before it can find the result set you’re
looking for. For an application with a large, monolithic database,
queries can become prohibitively slow. By sharding one table into
multiple, though, queries have to go over fewer rows and their result
sets are returned much more quickly.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As a final reason the article mentions this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sharding can also help to make an application more reliable by
mitigating the impact of outages. If your application or website
relies on an unsharded database, an outage has the potential to make
the entire application unavailable. With a sharded database, though,
an outage is likely to affect only a single shard. Even though this
might make some parts of the application or website unavailable to
some users, the overall impact would still be less than if the entire
database crashed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I mean to be honest I think there are more elegant solutions for
the above. It is a bit a forced point but I list it nonetheless in
here.
</p>

<p>
Note that there are as well quite some concepts as mentioned on the
referred source above that speaks counter the sharding idea.
</p>

<p>
Then for instance one classical sharding possibility is the
following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/db_key_sharding.png" class="center"><p>
Note that the above is just one possibility among the many sharding
possibilities.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0e13afe" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0e13afe">Linked Servers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e13afe">
<p>
These enable you to implement distributed databases that can fetch
and update data in other databases.
</p>

<p>
They are for instance a good solution in the scenarios where you
need to implement database sharding without need to create a custom
application code or directly load from remote data sources.
</p>

<p>
So basically with them you can do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ability to access data from outside of SQL Server</li>

<li>
<p>
The ability to issue distributed queries, updates, commands, and
transactions on heterogeneous data sources across the enterprise.
</p>

<p>
Think for instance again to the case of sharding. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the reason why we use this solution as a team is different
but this is another discussion I will not dig too much into.
</p>

<p>
Basically the way you implment this architecture is then the
following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/linked_server.png" class="center"><p>
So understand now that the set up we have at work is a bit
different.
</p>

<p>
It is not 100% the same. You can basically have server-to-server
links and you find these in your data studio under the following
path:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Server Objects -&gt; Linked Servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can then select that object and a databse in it in order to
make these cross-server SQL statements.

Note that when this is off it basically means that you cannot set
the identity key.
</p>

<p>
Note that with identity key - the primary key is ment.
</p>

<p>
The idea is essentially the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The primary key column is often set to auto-increment when
constructing a SQL Server database. The IDENTITY limit is set on for
the primary key column to do this. The starting location and step of
increment are transferred to the IDENTITY column as parameters. Then
whenever a new record is added, and the identity insert is set to OFF,
the value of the IDENTITY column is increased by the pre-defined step
normally a number.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So set it on or off depending on your needs. And it is obvious that
depending on your choice you will get errors or not if trying to
insert the primary key in an insert statement.

You can work with a merge statement in the following way:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">MERGE</span> <span class="n">targetTable</span>
   <span class="k">Using</span> <span class="n">sourceTable</span>
   <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">mergeCondition</span>
   <span class="k">WHEN</span> <span class="n">MATCHED</span>
   <span class="k">THEN</span> <span class="n">updateStatement</span>
   <span class="k">WHEN</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="n">MATCHED</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">TARGET</span>
   <span class="k">THEN</span> <span class="n">insertStatement</span>
   <span class="k">WHEN</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="n">MATCHED</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="k">SOURCE</span>
   <span class="k">THEN</span> <span class="n">deleteStatement</span>
</pre></div>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-04-28%20174632.png" class="center"><p>
So you understand that you apply different logic for different
matching statements.
</p>

<p>
Note that when you have a logical wrong condition, for instance
<code>source 1=0</code> then the condition is always fulfilled. This is
sometimes used in combination with merge in order to leverage the
output property. There are restrinctions for it with the insert
statement in this sense.

Note that this is a very particular data type.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that it can be either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
</p>

<p>
But note the tricky part of it. If you insert numbers higher than
<code>1</code>, it does not raise an error. It simply enters 1.

<p>
In this sense if you would like to have a proper boolean variable

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org843f85a">
<p>
So we have a heavy user of stored procedures in the team.
</p>

<p>
So he puts a lot of the business logic in SQL.
</p>

<p>
So there are stored procedures performing the relevant bit of the
application logic.
</p>

<p>
Now note that these stored procedures hold difficult business
logic.
</p>

<p>
Say for instance:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>declaring interim tables</li>

<li>try catch expressions raising errors</li>
</ul>
<p>
etc.
</p>

<p>
On the last one you need to understand a bit the logic of the error
messages.
</p>

<p>
This is all the info you have at times. But the developer is giving
you some info if you understand that error messages.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the message itself that is not always 100% exhaustive -
you have the severity number.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="n">RAISERROR</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">'This is message %s %d.'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">-- Message text.  </span>

<p>
Finally, decided to quickly write a note for it. The issue is the
following, you have the following visualization. You always forget
how to read it.
</p>

<p>
I periodically learn it and then after a while I do not recall it.
</p>

<p>
It is quite simple. Making an example here with left join such that
you will never waste any time with it anymore.
</p>

<p>
Basically the idea is the following:
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202022-05-04%20165746.png" class="center"><p>
So basically the difference is the following:
</p>

<p>
left-join: you keep all of the data from the left-side - i.e. the
<b>table you are joining</b>. This independently if there is a match or
not.
</p>

<p>
All of the attributes of the table you are joining with are null,
just if there is a matching, then you will have an equality
relation and you will be able to access the values for the attributes. 
</p>

<p>
If there is no matching the selected fields of the other table are
set to null.
</p>

<p>
And in a similar way you interpret all of the other relations in
there.
