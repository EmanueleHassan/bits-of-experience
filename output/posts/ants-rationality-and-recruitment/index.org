I discovered I was filmed when holding a presentation. I share the
video here. I consider this one of my greatest university
accomplishments as I discuss a paper I discovered which I think is
very powerful and every person should reason of the content presented
here reaching his/her personal conclusions.

Please watch below the video if interested. It talks about recruitment
as a very powerful social mechanism giving rise to very complex
dynamical structures.

Errata Corrige: /notice that when talking about the markov chains in
the talk I did not make the point explicit enough./

The idea is the following:

the transition kernel described give rise to a reversible
stationary distribution. Given this we know that an invariant
distribution exists.

Given the irresistibility property of the chain we know then that such
an invariant distribution must be unique and that we will converge to
it no matter the initial distribution.
