This post deals with music theory.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 
</p>

<p>
But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.
</p>

<p>
This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 
</p>

<p>
The general idea - in music and life is the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.
</p>

<p>
[… But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.
</p>

<p>
[…] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 
</p>

<p>
After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0a2d9a">
<p>
Everything in music can be reduced to intervals (or distances
between notes) and their relationships.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="orgcacbe8a">On Sound</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcacbe8a">
<p>
Recall all of the physics is contained in music:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Everything in nature is energy vibrating at different frequencies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So is sound - it is waves travelling through a medium - often
air. A specific sound has a pitch (the wavelength) - measuring the
frequency of the sound - and an amplitude - measuring the strength
of the sound.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202024-01-22%20210323.png" class="center"><p>
Recall as well that the human being has the capacity of hearing
sound in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. You always move in this
space so to say.
</p>

<p>
A note is then a specific named pitch. Aside from the pitch, notes
have other defining qualities - such as: <b>time duration</b>,
<b>loudness</b> and <b>quality</b>.
</p>

<p>
On the top of it you have the concept of <b>timbre</b>. This is a sound
color that comes from different instruments. For instance, a C
note on a piano is the same as a C note on a violin but we
experience them differently due to the different timbre.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> what we hear as a single note is actually a <i>whole
spectrum</i> of related higher frequencies coming from the
instrument, that our ears perceive, more or less, as a single
frequency. This is part of the reason why different instruments
have different <i>timbres</i>.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgddb53c5">
<p>
In a sense, studying harmony and melody boils down to studying
pitch and the relationships between different pitches.
</p>

<p>
The relationships between pitches are called intervals.

<h3 id="org0f46720">On Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f46720">
<p>
There are <b>12</b> notes in Western music.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A, A# or Bb, B, C, C# or Db, D, D# or Eb, E, F, F# or Gb, G, G#
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As you are learning the piano now - make sure you have the system
well in your mind. 
</p>

<p>
Note as well that there are no sharps or flats between B-C and
E-F. Once you have this well into your mind it will help you to
quickly find your way on the piano and will help you to navigate
the octaves and the different notes positions quickly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Exercise</i>: try to make sense of it at some stage and understand
why it turned out exactly like this.
</p>

<p>
Note as well that the notes without sharps or flats are called
<b>natural notes</b> in western tradition.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind the note circle in this sense. You will have to work
with it - it hides the structure of the tetrahedron that you still
have to figure out.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202024-01-22%20224313.png" class="center"><p>
Note that when you move clockwise you go higher in pitch. You use
the sharp notation in this case (#). When you move
counterclockwise you go lower in pitch. You use the flat notation
in this case (b).

<p>
In this sense notes are repeated in <b>higher and lower registers</b>.
You are very familiar with the concept simply by checking at a
piano.
</p>

<p>
Note that the distance between two notes in adjacents registers is
<b>an octave</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note that two notes distanced by an octave have the property that
taking a starting and ending point the amount of waves halves /

<h3 id="orgd7a09d5">On the 12-tone equal temperament and octave subdivision</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd7a09d5">
<p>
Note that once you have a tuning note set to some frequency the
question is on how to divide the frequency notes in an octave.
</p>

<p>
Here comes in the idea of equal temperament. 
</p>

<p>
You have 12 notes in an octave considering the sharps and
flats. The idea is then to divide the range of an octave given by
the ratios of 2 into 12 equal components.
</p>

<p>
<b>Each components equals a semitone</b>.
</p>

<p>
You will see then why you have two times two notes without a sharp
or a flat. This in order to stay with <b>6 tones for an octave</b> but
keep the 7 distinct natural notes.
</p>

<p>
Note that above it is stated that the octave is divided into 12
equal parts. How the "equality" is defined is tricky. It is not
equal in the <b>linear</b> scala but rather in the <b>logarithmic</b> scala.
</p>

<p>
Think about this; would it be linear you would divide the 2-factor
interval between two "equal" notes in the following way:
</p>

<p>
2/12 = 1/6 = 0.166666…
</p>

<p>
Meaning each note would be would distanced by a factor: 1.1666666
</p>

<p>
But the 12 - TET divides the two factor interval in the following
way:
</p>

<p>
12th root of 2 = 1.059463…. (irrational number)
</p>

<p>
So understand that the distance between two numbers increases
logarithmically by this factor.

<h3 id="orgc143bff">Overtone Series and Just Intonation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc143bff">
<p>
Note that this was the standard before the 12-TET system came into
being. 
</p>

<p>
It is based on the <b>harmonic or overtone series</b>.
</p>

<p>
This as the square root of two and five and the golden
ratio. There is structure in the universe if you train your 
eye to see it. 
</p>

<p>
The harmonic series is defined in the following way and the sound
produced by playing one note creates a series of overtone waves
represented by the harmonic fractions in the harmonic series.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202024-02-15%20211524.png" class="center"><p>
Understand that the waves of overtone are shorter in wavelength as
characterized by the harmonic fractions. In this sense
<b>over</b>-tone.
</p>

<p>
Understand as well that the term <b>harmonic</b> series actually
derives from the overtone series. These are harmonic.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202024-02-15%20212019.png" class="center"><p>
Finally, note that architects made use of such harmonic
proportions in the Baroque period. Many buildings of that period
where constructed following such harmonic series. 
</p>

<p>
You see once more how architect try to bring harmony in their
buildings. Be it via the golden ratio or such series. 
</p>

<p>
To sum up overtone series represents the naturally occurring
frequencies based on the intervals that <b>resonate perfectly</b> with
the initial fundamental note.
</p>

<p>
Note that different instruments have different amplitudes for
different harmonic series this is what ultimately constitutes the
timbre of an instrument. You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbLYD9KFAo">following video</a> to get
an idea.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that how overtones series and their implied
intervals to the fundamental note define Perfect, Major and Minor
proportions depending how the overtone interacts with the
fundamental note. <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eltonjohn/canyoufeelthelovetonight.html">There's a rhyme and rhythm to the wild
outdoors</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Given the above discussion it is easy to see how the just
intonation divides an octave.
</p>

<p>
Recall that you have 12 notes in EU musical system. Then basically
you can divide the interval between two notes via harmonic series.
</p>

<p>
I.e. the distances between notes (=intervals) are represented by
the ratios of the harmonic series such that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A4 = 440 Hz</li>

<li>A5 = 880 Hz = 1:2 distance</li>

<li>
<p>
E5 2/3 = 440  (Harmonic Series) = Meaning subtracting 1:3 of the
new note will bring you to the root.
</p>

<p>
= (440 / 2) * 3  = 660 Hz
</p>
</li>

<li>D5 4/5 = 440 = 587.33 Hz</li>

<li>Etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interesting is to note the vicinity of the tone equal temperament
and the just intonation numbers.
</p>

<img src="../../images/Screenshot%202024-02-15%20221919.png" class="center"><p>
There seems to be <b>a relation between the 12th root of 2 and the
first 12 elements in the harmonic series</b>.

<h2 id="org6060c90">Intervals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6060c90">
<p>
The idea here is that the absolute does not count. The distance
does. Such distances among notes are called intervals.
</p>

<p>
It can be said that all music theory is based around studying
intervals and how they make up music and affect our emotions.
</p>

<p>
You can check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDIm_2qS5s">this video</a> to get a taste of it.
</p>

<p>
Note that the perfect 5th represents the ratio 1:3 in the harmonic
series. The perfect 4th the ratio 1:4. Finally 1:5 series
represents the major 3rd.
</p>

<p>
In general note that the <b>perfect</b> intervals are more <b>stable and
safe</b>. This is how you can recognize them. Anytime a musical melody
ventures a bit, it can return to a safe and stable sound coming to
a note that is some Perfect interval apart.
</p>

<p>
As we move away from perfect intervals - we are moving away from
home, thus producing more dissonance. This creates movement and
build up tension and friction that tends to resolve to a home
sounding note.
</p>

<h3 id="orgf493f6d">Chromatic and Diatonic Intervals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf493f6d">
<p>
Intervals are grouped. Two important groups worth to mention are
the chromomatic intervals and the diatonic intervals.
</p>

<p>
The chromatic intervals contain all of the 12 intervals.
</p>

<p>
The diatonic intervals contain: Major and Perfect Intervals. These
are important cause their intervals define the Major scale. This
is the most fundamental scale in western music as we will see.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge8177fb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge8177fb">Harmony, Melody and Rhythm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge8177fb">
<p>
Note that the three define the lattice in which the music lives. 
</p>

<p>
The <b>rhythm</b> is the <b>relationship between sounds and their duration</b>
without respect to their pitches.
</p>

<p>
The <b>harmony</b> of a piece is the way the <b>notes in a piece would sound
if they were to be played simultaneously</b>. Think about it as playing
the relevant notes as in a chord. 
</p>

<p>
I.e. when focusing on the vertical structure between pitches
(=harmony) you are treating them as though they were happening at
the same time (even if they are happening one after another).
</p>

<p>
The <b>melody</b> of a piece is how notes sound in sequence. <b>Melody</b> is all
about <b>how notes sound together in a sequence</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Note that two pieces could have the same harmonic value but a
different melodic value, given that the notes might occur in a
different sequence.
</p>

<p>
Note that so far it was not understood what makes up a nice
melody. But what was understood is the importance of dynergic
structure. I.e. it is important that the melody moves and unfolds;
build up tension and releases. That means that a good melody moves
away from the harmonic center; builds up tension; and then moves
back in some form to it; releasing the tension.
</p>

<p>
In this sense; it is similar to good sex. In any case there is no
major formula for it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNwnlBVg09Q">Each child is drumming his own way</a> after all.
