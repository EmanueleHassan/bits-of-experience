[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtf7hC17IBM][Sometimes you win; sometimes you loose]]. 

It is tough; to acknowledge that I am a monster in some people's eyes
is not easy.

But by now; I understood the lesson: Just keep going - no feeling is final.

{{{TEASER_END}}}

I stopped writing for a bit. I stopped because I was scared. I was
told not to write anymore. That it is dangerous. After all - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GUm5g8SG4o][anything
you say can and will be used against you into court of law]].

But free thinking is important - too important to give up. I
understood that it is the basis of the occidental society. Nothing is
hidden - all the thoughts are out there. You just have to pick the ones
you like the most and live your life accordingly. As long as you do
not hurt - verbally or physically - anyone, it is in your rights to
live your life the way you want. I consider it to be a blessing to
have the chance to live in such a society where nothing is really
imposed top-down.

On the top of it I think that no one will care about words of an
unemployed. It is just words of a pirla - an italian idiot.

I understood that this blog got more readers than intended in the
past.

It was tough to realize it. Some of you might have had fun reading it
but living the consequences, in first person, I must tell you that it
was anything but fun. You may refer to the first video for more.

Just now I am understanding the wise message of the Article 31; they
always wrote bright texts and did in fact know the price you pay for
being on the spotlight.

E ad un certo punto saranno tutti amici tuoi, diranno di amarti per
quello che sei vorranno solo privarti di un pezzo di quello che hai.

[...]

Ma ci sarà sempre la mamma - che ha gli occhi più giovani di noi.

[...]

Non importa se modelle o commesse, certe donne si faranno gioco di
te. Trattale tutte da principesse e sarai un re.

[...]

E ad un certo punto finita la festa vedrai tutti andare via, ti
accorgerai che quel poco che resta ti basta ed ecco quella sarà casa tua.

(Consigli di un Pirla)

I think that I am slowly finding home. But I still need people to
leave the party.

[[https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/nothing-to-see-here-the-evolution-of-a-catchphrase][Nothing to see here]]: just an unemployed free thinker. 

You might follow this blog or not. But I decided I will not let
censorship win my thoughts and to continue writing. It helps me to put
order in my thoughts and navigate better [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmSKX5TF3g][the white noise]] of life.

As for me; well.. I still need to recover from all of this but I hope
that I will soon be ready for [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzuXZfKg2YM][part II]].
