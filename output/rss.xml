So this is a brief post containing my template for working on IT
systems design.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use it when working on projects as a way to keep the system under
control through time and to have a general overview of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top it is good to align the general stakeholders involved in
the system on the general status and direction for the system.
&lt;/p&gt;

So basically this is a very quick post on how to properly version your
libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Essentially, you will use it in both of your python packages twine
uploads and in your gradle java libraries packages. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, it is important as once you appreciate the proper way of
versioning libraries you will understand why Azure DevOps prevents you
from uploading two libraries with the same version - or let's say to
overwrite the thing. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You will understand that this actually happens as a way to indicate
you that you should comply with standard versioning systems used
across the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In general there are two different schools of working with the general
versioning schema. You should decide which school you want to comply
with. I will explore the both in this post. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-correct-library-versioning-scheme/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (4 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>java</category><category>Python</category><category>software-engineering</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-correct-library-versioning-scheme/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:07:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Code Quality Management and Monitoring</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/code-quality-management-and-monitoring/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So basically this post contains a way to statically analyze your code
in order to see the quality of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important in order find blind spots in your code. Moreover, it
is important to keep track of the history of the quality of the
software in time. So it is a very important piece of the puzzle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These notes are based on the gradle in action book.
&lt;/p&gt;

So I took a book out of the shelves at work. It is about SQL and
Relational Theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is so beautiful that it requires its own post:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SQL [structured query language] is full of difficulties and traps for
the unwary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can avoid them if you understand relational theory, but only if
you know how to put the theory into practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is all about the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://novoresume.com/career-blog/interview-star-method"&gt;star method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and that should always guide you.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>software-engineering</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-beautiful-sentence/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 11:02:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Programs Design</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-programs-design/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I am continuing my journeys into proper and solid software
engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically, I always used frameworks and in my first experience it was
out of question whether to use them. But the things were more short
term and now that the software that I am touching is very long lived
the situation is different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, the topic around framework and which exactly to use is a hot
topic in our team. Some prefer to avoid them as much as possible. Some
are heavy proponents of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As always it is ultimately a trade-off question. I am writing here
some points in order to make such trade-offs more explicit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact the way you decide to set up your software - such as trhoguh
inversion of control as when using frameworks or via simple libraries
and toolkits -, as well the task that the software is required to
complete will ultimately define the way you should set up and
program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the ultimate reason why there should be a thorough design
phase before touching any bit of code and immersing yourself into
it. What you do not design today will come to hunt you down tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Depending on the choice of your software set up you should as well
make strategic decisions that go hand in hand with it. This is the aim
of this post; to make this explicit. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-programs-design/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>frameworks</category><category>software-engineering</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-programs-design/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 07:46:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Festina Lente</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-festina-lente/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I am continuing my trip in the discovery of myself. I am still
learning how to properly run. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent events brought me to think a little bit about the tale of the
&lt;i&gt;turtle and the hare&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fables are what I usually go back to when I have to understand the
world. I think it is brilliant the way human being decided to infuse
tons of wisdom in little stories that are then taught to children in
order to teach them about life. So when I need help to understand the
world I turn into a child and refer back to the fables.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Actually I do not just turn back to fables, I turn as well to Disney
movies to get a bit of pills of wisdom such as: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08NlhjpVFsU"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoCYwefq1A"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiNy4d4gc"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now turning to the point of this blog and on the &lt;i&gt;tortoise and the hare&lt;/i&gt;,
on &lt;i&gt;Achilles and the Tortoise&lt;/i&gt;, on &lt;i&gt;Festina Lente&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So basically the idea of object relational mapping is the one of
mapping relational tables to objects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea is that a lot of times the application logic is in objects
while the persistency layer is in the relational schema.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That translation is annoying and time consuming. Plus it requires a
mind switch to think at the two different levels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea of this technology was essentially to develop a framework to
map the relational persistency layer to the ORM paradigm. In such a
way it is possible for the developer to wire his mind into a single
setting - the one of the objects and to properly develop in a pure
object oriented mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense this is a lot what is happening in the NoSQL space,
especially with the document store and the json communication format
for API.. the underlying driver must is the same…. avoid all of that
annoying conversions from one paradigm to the other.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So you see; always think in terms of drivers… you will anticipate
the future once you focus on the underlying driver and force instead
of on the concept itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In general much of these notes refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbwuWh_eH4AhVDwQIHHW0vC9sQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoclaptrinhdanang.com%2Fdownloads%2Fpdf%2Fspring%2FJava%2520Persistence%2520with%2520Hibernate.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0524Xl7sPIrS85z5EARMyP"&gt;following book&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note as well that as always you can debate about everything and you
shuold think when ORM and Hibernate - in the specific case - is a good
candidate and when not. See &lt;a href="https://www.eversql.com/i-followed-hibernate-orm-to-hell-and-came-back-alive-to-tell-about-it/"&gt;this dude&lt;/a&gt; post in general - also check the
last section. There is interesting referenced material.

&lt;p&gt;
This is as well another important component; it originates from &lt;a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/mappings/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I very much like these notes as they allow you to gain that high
level overview of the subject and high level understanding of the
thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can then think under these terms when checking at the thing and
you can correctly understand the operation you are doing when
working on the system. 
&lt;/p&gt;

So this post will prove as a repository for work around accounting
terms and concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lots and part of the cake is this translation from accounting measures
to economic ones through which you manage your stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The way this translation is done is important as it is quite core if
you want to get a thorough picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post contains some information in this dimension. As always
will start in a very light way and see if it grows then in time -
i.e. see if I come a lot across these concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also all that big stuff of IFRS17 and IFRS9. Would be cool to
watch a quick video of it… take time at some point. Just to have a
high level understanding of that and what it is going on in this
sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important as, as mentioned in the RiskMetics paper:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Only a limited number of trading items are marked to market.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

display: block;
margin-top: 60px;
margin-bottom: 60px;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
width: 70%;

}

.container {
  position: relative;
  left: 15%;
  margin-top: 60px;
  margin-bottom: 60px;
  width: 70%;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */

  overflow-y: hidden;

  right: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: none;
  display:block;
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So this tries to summarize a bit the concepts around RiskMetrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the industry standard in order to compute the risk numbers
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that the notes are based on &lt;a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mappings-motivation/"&gt;the following publication&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of
the statistical concepts are just a mere high level refresher. You
even checked at more sophisticated methods during your studies - see
for instance the GARCH and multivariate GARCH models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So lots of the material is skipped in these notes. Just saving the
interesting parts of it that do not add to the rest. Interesting was
especially the brief section &lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/riskmetrics/#org94ca1ca"&gt;From ALM to VaR&lt;/a&gt;. This is a thing that I
definitely have to understand better and the current location of the
industry and of the company in this dimension.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Important is as well to better understand that transition from
accounting values to market values. This is an entire very important
space that I have no clue about. Not so in line with my interests
cause I never liked too much accounting as a subject, but if you do
not understand that piece of the cake you might as well not loose time
in understanding all of the rest as everything starts from there.
&lt;/p&gt;
