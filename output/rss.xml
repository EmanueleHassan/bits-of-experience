So I am still making sense of all that happened since October 2023.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You made mistakes - and that is okey. You are human after all. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But now you have to look at them and learn from them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/but-at-least-we-stole-the-show/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>perRep</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/but-at-least-we-stole-the-show/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:58:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On the difference between wheel and sdist</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-difference-between-wheel-and-sdist/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
So I am using the time off to properly package my python code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to do that I am writing a series of posts: &lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/packaging-python-apps/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I came across poetry recently. This is a one tool for managing python
packages. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before that a step back to the python internals and a brief post in
order to properly understand wheels and sdist - these are two
different builds of your python package.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is a post where I hold some notes about data wrangling in R.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In general so far you always used the dplyr package. Check at the
project you did for Expedia in this sense. There you can refresh the
dplyr methods. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this post you will mainly check at the native data wrangling in R.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This will be useful for the coding exercise you will have to do. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top it will be useful as a repository for refreshing the
material when you need it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/r-data-wrangling/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/r-data-wrangling/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 18:27:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On a Fragile Mind</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-fragile-mind/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everything takes its toll. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a happy life for most of my time. There were little ghosts in my
life; until:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura
ché la diritta via era smarrita.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura esta selva selvaggia e aspra e
forte che nel pensier rinova la paura!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tant’è amara che poco è più morte; ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi
trovai, dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ho scorte.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So I will not focus on the details of the "selva oscura". I learned in
time that it is better to let it be. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I still have to face the scars that beasts of the selva oscura left in
my soul. After all I am a human and I am &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfBj4i8MKH4"&gt;fragile&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtf7hC17IBM"&gt;Sometimes you win; sometimes you loose&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is tough; to acknowledge that I am a monster in some people's eyes
is not easy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But by now; I understood the lesson: Just keep going - no feeling is final.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-beauty-of-free-thinking/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>perRep</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-beauty-of-free-thinking/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:10:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Music Theory</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/music-theory/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
This post deals with music theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The general idea - in music and life is the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[… But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[…] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/music-theory/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (11 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>music</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/music-theory/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 14:21:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Combinatorics</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-combinatorics/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
So this is another post containing basic mathematical things. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is about combinatorics. It is all material of high school level. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The issue is that you often make confusion and loose track of the
thing. This post is intended to summarize the knowledge such that you
can always come back at it and you will have it fresh in your memory.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-combinatorics/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mathematics</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-combinatorics/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 12:25:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On a Quick Glimpse into IFRS 17 and IFRS 9</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-quick-glimpse-into-ifrs-17-and-ifrs-9/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I am quickly checking into these for an interview. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It will be in no way thorough or complete. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is just for me to get a rough idea about the topic such that you
will not fall out of a tree if the things are mentioned. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-quick-glimpse-into-ifrs-17-and-ifrs-9/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>accounting</category><category>finance</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-quick-glimpse-into-ifrs-17-and-ifrs-9/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 13:14:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On some Linear and Non-Linear Programming concepts</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-some-linear-and-non-linear-programming-concepts/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So another posts where you should summarize a bit of concepts that you
already studied multiple times and you forget.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But these are important. I am doing now again some microeconomics and
there you have the concept of Pareto efficiency. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This comes from the property of shadow prices in linear
programming. The fact is that in these economics books they do not
focus on the math but to its application to the specific subject and
interpret the result based on the exercise at hand. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, that might make sense because you can understand some notions of
the subject at hand in such a way. This is the ultimate goal in
applied math.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But if you understand the general math behind it you then have a
general frame that you can apply to different subjects. This is why
you are interested in the general understanding of the math theory
behind it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You study it periodically and then you forget it. Not good. These
posts intend to fix the issue. You will have a digital place in the
future where you could find your results. 
&lt;/p&gt;

This post deals with equilibria in economics theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was always fascinated by the topic. I wanted to go in the topic at
some point but I postponed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent experiences just increased that fascination. &lt;i&gt;There is a rhythm
and reason to the wild out there&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is that invisible hand. Even in chaos theory there is an
equilibrium. "Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness
of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns,
interconnection, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity,
fractals, and self-organization." (source: Wiki)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I want to study these underlying patterns and the theory economics has
developed to address them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all once you understand the rhythm it is just an exercise of
getting the harmonics of the chaos.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that the notes are based on Starr's: General Equilibrium Theory book.
&lt;/p&gt;
