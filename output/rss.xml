&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtf7hC17IBM"&gt;Sometimes you win; sometimes you loose&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is tough; to acknowledge that I am a monster in some people's eyes
is not easy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But by now; I understood the lesson: Just keep going - no feeling is final.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-beauty-of-free-thinking/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>perRep</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-the-beauty-of-free-thinking/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:10:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Music Theory</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/music-theory/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
This post deals with music theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, recently I did stop the writing activity of the
blog. This due to external effects that should have not have
happened. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But as a great musician is as well a great composer, I am starting to
write again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This will help you to structure your thoughts and make mental order in
the many things that you encounter in your life voyage. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The general idea - in music and life is the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Understanding theory may even feel counterproductive, since it seems
like it will turn something expressive, something visceral, into
something plainly understandable. Something we can analyze and
explain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[… But watch out] when you know what to look for and you are
familiar in general with the aesthetics space that you are working in,
that space is richer and deeper. Period.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[…] There is a delicate balance, True beauty comes from understanding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is what ultimately this post is trying to do with music, and the
blog is trying to do in a bigger sense. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all, as Marcus Aurelius roughly mentioned in his meditations a
clean person should have no secrets and should always be able to share
his thoughts without hesitation.
&lt;/p&gt;

So this is another post containing basic mathematical things. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is about combinatorics. It is all material of high school level. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The issue is that you often make confusion and loose track of the
thing. This post is intended to summarize the knowledge such that you
can always come back at it and you will have it fresh in your memory.
&lt;/p&gt;

So I am quickly checking into these for an interview. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It will be in no way thorough or complete. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is just for me to get a rough idea about the topic such that you
will not fall out of a tree if the things are mentioned. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-quick-glimpse-into-ifrs-17-and-ifrs-9/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>accounting</category><category>finance</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-a-quick-glimpse-into-ifrs-17-and-ifrs-9/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 13:14:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On some Linear and Non-Linear Programming concepts</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-some-linear-and-non-linear-programming-concepts/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So another posts where you should summarize a bit of concepts that you
already studied multiple times and you forget.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But these are important. I am doing now again some microeconomics and
there you have the concept of Pareto efficiency. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This comes from the property of shadow prices in linear
programming. The fact is that in these economics books they do not
focus on the math but to its application to the specific subject and
interpret the result based on the exercise at hand. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, that might make sense because you can understand some notions of
the subject at hand in such a way. This is the ultimate goal in
applied math.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But if you understand the general math behind it you then have a
general frame that you can apply to different subjects. This is why
you are interested in the general understanding of the math theory
behind it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You study it periodically and then you forget it. Not good. These
posts intend to fix the issue. You will have a digital place in the
future where you could find your results. 
&lt;/p&gt;

This post deals with equilibria in economics theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was always fascinated by the topic. I wanted to go in the topic at
some point but I postponed. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent experiences just increased that fascination. &lt;i&gt;There is a rhythm
and reason to the wild out there&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is that invisible hand. Even in chaos theory there is an
equilibrium. "Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness
of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns,
interconnection, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity,
fractals, and self-organization." (source: Wiki)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I want to study these underlying patterns and the theory economics has
developed to address them. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all once you understand the rhythm it is just an exercise of
getting the harmonics of the chaos.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that the notes are based on Starr's: General Equilibrium Theory book.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is another of these topics that I always study and forget. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But it is quite basics stuff and it pops up continuously so it is
better for you to get to know it properly and well fix it into your
brain.

This is a repository where I hold some notes about the major sklearn
analytics algorithm in order to perform your data science.

Nothing for the public. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a very personal post in order to understand how you work on
the new laptop. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have no time to dig deeper right now and fix the workflow. Have to
go with these shortcuts. 
&lt;/p&gt;

So it is slowly becoming clear that golden numbers are the core.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Geometry is important and you should understand better these.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They carry most of the information that is around in the world. They
are very powerful numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Understand them, understand well the golden mean spiral, fibonacci and
binary and you will have a profound understanding of the things.
