this blog contains the major IBM cloud CLI commands to operate with
some of the data services in the cloud.

It especially focus around DaaS and MLaaS.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This are my personal notes w.r.t. Hyperledger Fabric technology. The
document basically consists of a structured &lt;i&gt;collage&lt;/i&gt; from the
freely available resources concerning Hyperledger Fabric.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The content for such document is not to subscribe to myself. The
structure is and corresponds to the structure that naturally arose when
getting to know the content. All the content stems from the
sources mentioned at the bottom in the &lt;i&gt;Resources&lt;/i&gt; section. You can
refer to this is you are searching for a more thorough explanation of
the technology. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is possibly not even a post. Rather a quick entry but I like my
blog with the different tags to find the material quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started recently using tramp mode to ssh into some Raspberry devices
as I got some &lt;i&gt;TJbots&lt;/i&gt; to play with. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was aware that with tramp mode you could simply ssh into a file and
edit it from your local device, no &lt;i&gt;nano&lt;/i&gt; or such horrible programs
needed. Moreover you keep your IoT device thin as you don't have to
install any special software on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, I was missing a proper shell on it. It turned out that if you
start an &lt;code&gt;eshell&lt;/code&gt; while being sshed into a file on your IoT device
via tramp mode you will have your wonderful &lt;code&gt;eshell&lt;/code&gt; written
completely in emacs and customizable according to your needs, with all
of the nice auto-completition on the top of it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There seems to be some overhead, as sometimes it reacts sluggishly
however this is hardly noticeable and a great way to work on remote
devices to my mind.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/tramp-mode/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 16:08:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Local Variables &amp; MobileOrg</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/localvar/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During the last couple of weeks I completed an emacs integration I
desired to complete since long time. I managed to fully synchronize my
emacs calendar with an online one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This allows me to have an integrated look and finally work on a
consistent agenda across devices to organize myself better. It
moreover allows me to have a quick glimpse on my agenda in emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to do that I relied on &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; nice video of &lt;i&gt;C'est la Z&lt;/i&gt;. The
basic idea is to integrate the Emacs Calendar and synchronize it with
your Google Calendar such that each time you open your agenda on Emacs
your org-agenda will be imported in the Google Calendar and conversely
the Google Calendar entries will be integrated into your org
agenda. You can find the details of the step up in the above link and
this will not be discussed in the post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nonetheless, I further enriched the approach with an integration via
&lt;code&gt;mobileorg&lt;/code&gt;. This allows me to write new entries in my agenda directly
from my mobile and allows me a more emacs-focused approach and better
deletion and archiving possibilities in comparison to working on the
Google Calendar on my phone. The structure is the following.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, I heard about the Monty Hall problem. Smth felt wrong and I
was chased by it in the last days. I think it attacks the very roots
of statistical thinking and I claim that the standard answer - switch
door - is poor.  If interested you can read about the problem on
wikipedia and continue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post explores the Gibbs sampler algorithm. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Bayesian Statistics sometimes it is not possible to integrate
analytically over the posterior distribution. It is hence not possible
to minimize over the loss function spanned by the posterior
distribution of the parameters of interest in order to take the bayes
decision.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A solution in this case is to leverage simulation to obtain an
i.i.d. sample of the posterior distribution of the parameters of
interest. Given an i.i.d. sample of it is then possible to leverage
the properties of the CLT to get an unbiased estimate of the
parameters of interest. This is for instance the backbone of
simulation methods such as Monte Carlo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A further evolution consists in generating a dependent sample from the
distribution of interest through a reversible Markov Chain. In such a
case it is possible to prove that the series generated from the Markov
Chain will converge to the stationary equilibrium of the Chain -
i.e. the distribution of interest - such that it is possible at a
later stage to apply the CLT to the converged series to obtain
estimates and CI for the parameters of interest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense the Gibbs Sampler is an algorithm generating explicitly
a reversible Markov Chain that gives the opportunity to obtain
estimates for the parameter of interest from a nasty, analytically not
integrable posterior distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To illustrate the algorithm the post looks now at the simple case of
sampling from a bivariate distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So far in the ANOVA series no special structure was assumed for the
treatments but rather that each treatment corresponded to a single
factor. This post starts to expand and relax the above assumption
looking at the relation when a treatment is the result of various
combination of individual factors. Think for instance of a plant being
influenced both by &lt;i&gt;light exposure&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fertilizer&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In case of the above structure we talk about a &lt;i&gt;factorial treatment
structure&lt;/i&gt; and this one will be explored next.
&lt;/p&gt;

Last week I received the last piece to get up and running my ThinkPad
USB-3.0 docking station. While, the configuration worked out of the
box for windows systems, configuring the docking station with Ubuntu
OS was not straightforward.
