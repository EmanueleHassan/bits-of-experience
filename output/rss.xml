So I am continuing my journeys into proper and solid software
engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically, I always used frameworks and in my first experience it was
out of question whether to use them. But the things were more short
term and now that the software that I am touching is very long lived
the situation is different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, the topic around framework and which exactly to use is a hot
topic in our team. Some prefer to avoid them as much as possible. Some
are heavy proponents of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As always it is ultimately a trade-off question. I am writing here
some points in order to make such trade-offs more explicit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact the way you decide to set up your software - such as trhoguh
inversion of control as when using frameworks or via simple libraries
and toolkits -, as well the task that the software is required to
complete will ultimately define the way you should set up and
program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the ultimate reason why there should be a thorough design
phase before touching any bit of code and immersing yourself into
it. What you do not design today will come to hunt you down tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Depending on the choice of your software set up you should as well
make strategic decisions that go hand in hand with it. This is the aim
of this post; to make this explicit. 
&lt;/p&gt;

So I am continuing my trip in the discovery of myself. I am still
learning how to properly run. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent events brought me to think a little bit about the tale of the
&lt;i&gt;turtle and the hare&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fables are what I usually go back to when I have to understand the
world. I think it is brilliant the way human being decided to infuse
tons of wisdom in little stories that are then taught to children in
order to teach them about life. So when I need help to understand the
world I turn into a child and refer back to the fables.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Actually I do not just turn back to fables, I turn as well to Disney
movies to get a bit of pills of wisdom such as: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08NlhjpVFsU"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoCYwefq1A"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiNy4d4gc"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now turning to the point of this blog and on the &lt;i&gt;tortoise and the hare&lt;/i&gt;,
on &lt;i&gt;Achilles and the Tortoise&lt;/i&gt;, on &lt;i&gt;Festina Lente&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-festina-lente/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>perRep</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-festina-lente/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 08:30:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Object Relational Mapping</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/object-relational-mapping/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;style&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So basically the idea of object relational mapping is the one of
mapping relational tables to objects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea is that a lot of times the application logic is in objects
while the persistency layer is in the relational schema.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That translation is annoying and time consuming. Plus it requires a
mind switch to think at the two different levels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea of this technology was essentially to develop a framework to
map the relational persistency layer to the ORM paradigm. In such a
way it is possible for the developer to wire his mind into a single
setting - the one of the objects and to properly develop in a pure
object oriented mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense this is a lot what is happening in the NoSQL space,
especially with the document store and the json communication format
for API.. the underlying driver must is the same…. avoid all of that
annoying conversions from one paradigm to the other.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So you see; always think in terms of drivers… you will anticipate
the future once you focus on the underlying driver and force instead
of on the concept itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In general much of these notes refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbwuWh_eH4AhVDwQIHHW0vC9sQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoclaptrinhdanang.com%2Fdownloads%2Fpdf%2Fspring%2FJava%2520Persistence%2520with%2520Hibernate.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0524Xl7sPIrS85z5EARMyP"&gt;following book&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note as well that as always you can debate about everything and you
shuold think when ORM and Hibernate - in the specific case - is a good
candidate and when not. See &lt;a href="https://www.eversql.com/i-followed-hibernate-orm-to-hell-and-came-back-alive-to-tell-about-it/"&gt;this dude&lt;/a&gt; post in general - also check the
last section. There is interesting referenced material.

&lt;p&gt;
This is as well another important component; it originates from &lt;a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/mappings/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I very much like these notes as they allow you to gain that high
level overview of the subject and high level understanding of the
thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can then think under these terms when checking at the thing and
you can correctly understand the operation you are doing when
working on the system. 
&lt;/p&gt;

So this post will prove as a repository for work around accounting
terms and concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lots and part of the cake is this translation from accounting measures
to economic ones through which you manage your stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The way this translation is done is important as it is quite core if
you want to get a thorough picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post contains some information in this dimension. As always
will start in a very light way and see if it grows then in time -
i.e. see if I come a lot across these concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also all that big stuff of IFRS17 and IFRS9. Would be cool to
watch a quick video of it… take time at some point. Just to have a
high level understanding of that and what it is going on in this
sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important as, as mentioned in the RiskMetics paper:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Only a limited number of trading items are marked to market.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  right: 0;

  height: 100%;
  border: none;
  display:block;
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So this tries to summarize a bit the concepts around RiskMetrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the industry standard in order to compute the risk numbers
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that the notes are based on &lt;a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mappings-motivation/"&gt;the following publication&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of
the statistical concepts are just a mere high level refresher. You
even checked at more sophisticated methods during your studies - see
for instance the GARCH and multivariate GARCH models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So lots of the material is skipped in these notes. Just saving the
interesting parts of it that do not add to the rest. Interesting was
especially the brief section &lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/riskmetrics/#org03653fe"&gt;From ALM to VaR&lt;/a&gt;. This is a thing that I
definitely have to understand better and the current location of the
industry and of the company in this dimension.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Important is as well to better understand that transition from
accounting values to market values. This is an entire very important
space that I have no clue about. Not so in line with my interests
cause I never liked too much accounting as a subject, but if you do
not understand that piece of the cake you might as well not loose time
in understanding all of the rest as everything starts from there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So writing a quick notes about this as I see a lot of confusion in my
broader team around this topic and want to make sense in this space
and create a bit of order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So basically the topic is around &lt;i&gt;full revaluation methods vs. factor
based revaluation methods&lt;/i&gt;. This was a bit the topic of the talk of the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-risk-valuation-methods/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>finance</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-risk-valuation-methods/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 13:39:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>what to migrate</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/what-to-migrate/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So every day I am more close to a perfect set up on my local machine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question is then how to make sure that you have a smooth
transition in case you change your laptop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sooner or later this will happen and I do not want to loose too much
time setting everything up properly again.
&lt;/p&gt;

So this post holds some information around the packaging of python
applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This will be handy to enter in the serious development world of the
language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This touches a lot as well the point of going in direction DevOps and
consequently it will be foundamental to go in direction MLOps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So you already worked with python testing frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The set up was already in place back then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now it is more than a year that I do not touch the thing and
everything is solidly gone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Luckily I have a repo on my Github with some structure of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will leverage that now, plus I will start to write some notes, such
that people that will have to collaborate with me can reference to
it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top of it, it will be useful for the future as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Plus finally it is always nice to see the things in multiple
languages. It is always the same story. By adding pieces to the puzzle
the picture becomes systematically clearer not the opposite. 
&lt;/p&gt;
