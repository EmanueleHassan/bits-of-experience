&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During the last couple of weeks I completed an emacs integration I
desired to complete since long time. I managed to fully synchronize my
emacs calendar with an online one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This allows me to have an integrated look and finally work on a
consistent agenda across devices to organize myself better. It
moreover allows me to have a quick glimpse on my agenda in emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to do that I relied on &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-26-gcal/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; nice video of &lt;i&gt;C'est la Z&lt;/i&gt;. The
basic idea is to integrate the Emacs Calendar and synchronize it with
your Google Calendar such that each time you open your agenda on Emacs
your org-agenda will be imported in the Google Calendar and conversely
the Google Calendar entries will be integrated into your org
agenda. You can find the details of the step up in the above link and
this will not be discussed in the post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nonetheless, I further enriched the approach with an integration via
&lt;code&gt;mobileorg&lt;/code&gt;. This allows me to write new entries in my agenda directly
from my mobile and allows me a more emacs-focused approach and better
deletion and archiving possibilities in comparison to working on the
Google Calendar on my phone. The structure is the following.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently, I heard about the Monty Hall problem. Smth felt wrong and I
was chased by it in the last days. I think it attacks the very roots
of statistical thinking and I claim that the standard answer - switch
door - is poor.  If interested you can read about the problem on
wikipedia and continue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post explores the Gibbs sampler algorithm. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Bayesian Statistics sometimes it is not possible to integrate
analytically over the posterior distribution. It is hence not possible
to minimize over the loss function spanned by the posterior
distribution of the parameters of interest in order to take the bayes
decision.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A solution in this case is to leverage simulation to obtain an
i.i.d. sample of the posterior distribution of the parameters of
interest. Given an i.i.d. sample of it is then possible to leverage
the properties of the CLT to get an unbiased estimate of the
parameters of interest. This is for instance the backbone of
simulation methods such as Monte Carlo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A further evolution consists in generating a dependent sample from the
distribution of interest through a reversible Markov Chain. In such a
case it is possible to prove that the series generated from the Markov
Chain will converge to the stationary equilibrium of the Chain -
i.e. the distribution of interest - such that it is possible at a
later stage to apply the CLT to the converged series to obtain
estimates and CI for the parameters of interest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense the Gibbs Sampler is an algorithm generating explicitly
a reversible Markov Chain that gives the opportunity to obtain
estimates for the parameter of interest from a nasty, analytically not
integrable posterior distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To illustrate the algorithm the post looks now at the simple case of
sampling from a bivariate distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So far in the ANOVA series no special structure was assumed for the
treatments but rather that each treatment corresponded to a single
factor. This post starts to expand and relax the above assumption
looking at the relation when a treatment is the result of various
combination of individual factors. Think for instance of a plant being
influenced both by &lt;i&gt;light exposure&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fertilizer&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In case of the above structure we talk about a &lt;i&gt;factorial treatment
structure&lt;/i&gt; and this one will be explored next.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last week I received the last piece to get up and running my ThinkPad
USB-3.0 docking station. While, the configuration worked out of the
box for windows systems, configuring the docking station with Ubuntu
OS was not straightforward.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/monitor-driver-thinkpad-dock-usb-30/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (1 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Hardware Config</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/monitor-driver-thinkpad-dock-usb-30/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 07:35:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Contrasts and Multiple Testing</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/contrasts-and-multiple-testing/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So far in the &lt;i&gt;ANOVA&lt;/i&gt; series we have encountered a simple one-way
analysis of variance test. This was based on the idea of comparing the
standardized sum of squares of the treatment effect and the one of the
stochastic component. We did this with the &lt;i&gt;omnibus&lt;/i&gt; F-test testing
the null of no-effect of the treatments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What happens however when we have a rather specific question, such as
the when we are concerned about the effect of a specific
treatment/factor and we question whether this is significant?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post discusses the comparison of different effects among
different groups. It will start with a refresh of the &lt;i&gt;t-test&lt;/i&gt; 
used for &lt;i&gt;pair-wise&lt;/i&gt; comparison among different groups and it extends
the concept for situations with \(groups \geq 2\) in order to check
whether results are statistically significant among them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will explore in this post the so called one-way analysis of
variance, where the &lt;i&gt;one-way&lt;/i&gt; part results from the fact that a single
&lt;i&gt;factor&lt;/i&gt; is analysed. Further posts will generalize the analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the first post making notes on the ANOVA - &lt;i&gt;analysis of
variance&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic research question of the study of the ANOVA is how to
compare different research outputs and how to assess whether the
difference among two or more group outcomes are statistically
significant or rather the result of randomness. In this sense a
special attention is given to the &lt;b&gt;experimental error&lt;/b&gt;, which
represent the natural variation and error observed in an untouched
environment from the unconditioned underlying data generating
process. Just with this notion of "true/underlying" randomness the
interpretation of the results is sensible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This first post, starts to explore the above by making the point of
the difficulties underlying such studies and the importance of the
experimental settings which the researcher is exposed to. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the cloud environment, when deploying an application through a
kubernetes cluster a question that naturally arise is how to save
data and general information. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What you actually want to achieve is to mount a file system on your
containers and read it as it was local.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This posts tries to make the point for the general approached used to
tackle the issue.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last week I set up my working laptop and the SSH key to access my
private working github repository.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A question arise: &lt;i&gt;How to add an additional SSH-key to modify the
content on my public github registry?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As usual a simple query to my favorite research engine solved the
issue. I refer therefore to the following blog post well outlining the
solution for the issue: &lt;a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574"&gt;multiple keys for different accounts&lt;/a&gt;.
