Wow… everything is a fight on this new system.
</p>

<p>
even with nikola there were some issues. first of all I was getting an
execute-error concerining some zipped-function defined in the markdown
file. the solution for it was to downgrade to a <a href="https://forum.drawbot.com/topic/247/markdown-syntax-for-formattedstring">previous version of
markdown</a>. Actually it turned out that was not that important in the
first place as the very root cause was not cause by some missing/malfunctioning
python packages but rather by the following.

I already posted about the set-up of plantuml <a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/uml-diagrams-with-plantuml/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is a very hand tool to manage complexity. In my new position
complexity is all around and over me.
</p>

<p>
The system is big and you need to keep cold blood, strucutre and
overview. I think this will be the main challange. In this sense the
best way for me to operate will be to create good technical
documentation of the system that I can always refer to.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is a very good friend in this sense. With all of the tags and
<code>TODO</code>, <code>ISSUES</code> workflow it will be possible for me to store the
general structure of the system and to keep a log and search across it
in order to manage such huge complexity.
</p>

<p>
Such tagged documentation in combination with the possibility to
export my notes in very readable <code>html</code> documents and the possibility
to write architectural diagrams via <code>plantuml</code> will be my big ally in
this in new challenge.
</p>

<p>
You can then store such <code>html</code> in blob stores and make them available
across the team.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes on resources you can refere to when writing your
architectural diagrams and general documentation for your projects.
</p>

<p>
Find the official documentation <a href="http://plantuml.com/en/guide">here</a>.

So I will work quite a lot with Java in the next couple of years. So I
have to properly set up a strong IDE and workflow for working in it.
</p>

<p>
I know that the majority of the people do not think much of emacs in
terms of IDE but since the language-server-protocol integrations I
believe they can be as strong as more mainstream IDEs such as Visual
Code out there. t.
</p>

<p>
I even think that they can be better once you get into it
enough. After a bit of research I am quite sure about the fact.
</p>

<p>
In fact this was my experience with Python and now the step is simply
to get ot that level of costumization with emacs. So here some notes
on my way of making emacs a top environment for java and improve my
productivity with it in the long-term.

So in my new job role there is gonna be quite some SQL so here some
notes on some important DB concepts.

not on pure SQL.

<p>
Java should become my major programming lanaguage in the next
years. The goal is to get proficient at in a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
I think it is a good thing cause as a programmer the fact that I was
never was exposed to Java was in fact a pity. Many of the most
interesting software of 21st century is written in Java (think of
Hadoop stack, Kafka &amp; Co.). While coming from the world of data
science I see the point for python I must say that once you have
extremely wide productive systems it might very well make sense to use
a more structured language as Java. Plus you should get up to speed
the functional language possibilities of Java available from Java 8
on. I think that this might boost even more the Java lanaguage and
make it a strong candidate for python-alike workflows.
</p>

<p>
That said let's go. Enjoy this new ride and absorb the language.
</p>

<p>
Note that all of the notes about the general syntax of the language
come from "Java the complete reference - 7th edition (Herbert
Schildt)" publicly available on the world wide web at <a href="https://gfgc.kar.nic.in/sirmv-science/GenericDocHandler/138-a2973dc6-c024-4d81-be6d-5c3344f232ce.pdf">this url</a>.

So I finally took some time to go over the documentation and make some
notes about the different naming conventions and some basics
structures you should get when building larger projects.
</p>

<p>
I just finished a third larger python project and I am by now
conscious of the strength of well organized code. It can save you a
very big amount of time, especially when your projects start to grow
very large and it becomes difficult to keep a clean mental structure
over the code-base.
</p>

<p>
I therefore started to write a couple of posts where I am writing and
will update my way of working and structuring projects. I will expand
on it in time once my knowledge will expand and more sophistication
will occur.
</p>

<p>
This particular posts deals with the basics structures that you have
to understand to properly set up projects and manage to well deal with
larger code-bases.

So I recently finished the books I was reading. I was out of books
and did not want to go buy some in a book-shop; here they mostly
sell books in German and I rather prefer to read books in
English…
</p>

<p>
So I started to search in my room where I found the book - Il
Confine del Futuro - a book by an IBM Research Scientist about
Artificial Intelligence my family gave me about 2 years ago; when
they got that I was interested in the subject.
</p>

<p>
It was nice of them - I even found some writings wishing me good
luck for the new adventure - each in his personal way reflecting
the character… Was nice and fun to read them.
</p>

<p>
Anyways… I did not read it at first… the title sounded too
vague. The classical book leveraging the buzz, trying to outline and
solve questions for which there is no answer.
</p>

<p>
Being the left-over I started to read it and in two evenings I was
over with it. It is quite some lite book that you can go over
quickly. Here my sum-up.

So I was working - of course with a bit of music. Those who know me
well know that I cannot work in the silence. I never did that, even
when studying highly theoretical material I must feel my blood flowing
and set my mind free. Just then I can enter my working mood properly.
</p>

<p>
So this time I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOyfLBYtuU&amp;list=RDMMxWx3R7WaAQY&amp;index=28">this song</a> and something beautiful
occurred.

Here are some notes about how to set up a project.
</p>

<p>
I will use this strucuture in the following projects I will have to
do.
</p>

<p>
For the last project I set up the project from scratch and I think
that I finally found my way to structure Python Projects in the right
way.
</p>

<p>
Right way - this means - a way that satisfies the following properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is modular. This is extremely important. If you manage to work in
a modular way by clearly separating logical structures you might use
some of these structures for further projects you will work on.</li>

<li>It is portable - by the very same argument explained above.</li>

<li>It is minimal - no double effort</li>

<li>It has strong logic - i.e. it is clear what modules and sub-modules
represent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will go into structure and some examples of how to reach such
components next.
</p>

<p>
Note again that this is my second larger project where starting from a
green field I could set everything up. You might want to change and
expand on this structure in following projects.
</p>

<p>
Please, do so and do not forget to expand on that.

So recently I had to do quite some big refactoring and merging for
some code base.
</p>

<p>
I knew about emacs <code>ediffing</code> packages that I used already a couple
of times in the past. It is just a little bit confusing at the
beginning as it is often the case with emacs, you might well be
overwhelmed at the beginning. Too many nice features and you might
quickly get lost in it.
</p>

<p>
The below video should give you a quick introduction to ediffing in
emacs. It is just a very basic tutorial. Then to get more detailed
information you should check at the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html">official documentation</a> (at the
quick help commands section) telling you about all of the different
commands that are quite a few.
