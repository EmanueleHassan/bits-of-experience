So here some notes about the macro side of the coin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started reading the &lt;a href="https://www.zurich.com/en/economics-and-markets/publications"&gt;weekly publications&lt;/a&gt; of the macro-group of
Zurich.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I must say that it is interesting. I always loved macro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I always recall the book of Blanchard. I think that this was the most
intersting theories I read throughout my academic life. Stat is
nice.. but way too much low level that higher world modeling dimension
is missing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I mean think Black-Scholes. That is also fun if I think about it now
again. A simple mathematical formula - confusing tons of
practitioners - through that stat low level stuff moving trillions of
dollars which is then ultimately resulting from very questionable
first-order assumptions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I am fascinated about how this world sticks together and is
not simply falling apart. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, back to Macroeconomics, at some point I thought that my life
was gonna be around it. &lt;i&gt;Kaynes vs. Hayek&lt;/i&gt; in an endless pointless
fight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that there is an inherent beauty in observing that
macro-picture making guesses about how the dots are connected.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Speculating on the reaction of CB etc. lovely. At the end they all
follow the common principles. Until the "business" does not require a
big shift.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any case here the list - which I guess will keep expanding in the
coming years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is important to understand all of these different components as if
you will stay for a long time in the industry and you will manage to
navigate data quickly some interesting patterns might start to emerge.
&lt;/p&gt;

So this is about a major trend in the insurance space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is one of the many posts in order to properly understand the
balance sheets of insurance companies that you will directly or
indirectly work with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a strong trend in structuring products that merge classical
insurance products with more traditional market-side investment
exposure in equties and bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is in fact what you invested in when doing your 3b plan via life
insurance. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what is a Market Risk System?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post tries to answer that question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post aims to be the guide for your intrinsic motivation for
working on the system and should pose the basis for reaching higher
goals in your work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is important to have goals in life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is the same as in the field of mathematics. People say that once
you have a proper problem definition you are half-way through the
problem, everything else is sequential.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So let's define and let's hope then everything will be sequential
then. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution"&gt;following entry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So recently I had an interview for a quantitative finance
position. I completely failed the preparation as it was not at all
about financial instruments but much more about econometrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, here the notes I did for this preparation session. I
mainly prepared following &lt;a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/finance/the-50-market-risk-interview-questions-you-need-to-anticipate"&gt;these notes&lt;/a&gt; as I was told that one of the
interviewer would be of the market risk division.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it turned out that this is a super nice team but is much
more about times series and econometrics than classical market risk
theory as you are being taught in University.
&lt;/p&gt;
