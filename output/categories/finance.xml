So this post will prove as a repository for work around accounting
terms and concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lots and part of the cake is this translation from accounting measures
to economic ones through which you manage your stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The way this translation is done is important as it is quite core if
you want to get a thorough picture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post contains some information in this dimension. As always
will start in a very light way and see if it grows then in time -
i.e. see if I come a lot across these concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is also all that big stuff of IFRS17 and IFRS9. Would be cool to
watch a quick video of it… take time at some point. Just to have a
high level understanding of that and what it is going on in this
sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is important as, as mentioned in the RiskMetics paper:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For many institutions the bulk of activities are reported on an
accrual basis, i.e., transactions are booked at historical costs +/-
accruals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Only a limited number of trading items are marked to market.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So this tries to summarize a bit the concepts around RiskMetrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the industry standard in order to compute the risk numbers
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that the notes are based on &lt;a href="https://www.value-at-risk.net/primary-mappings-motivation/"&gt;the following publication&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of
the statistical concepts are just a mere high level refresher. You
even checked at more sophisticated methods during your studies - see
for instance the GARCH and multivariate GARCH models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So lots of the material is skipped in these notes. Just saving the
interesting parts of it that do not add to the rest. Interesting was
especially the brief section &lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/riskmetrics/#org65def7e"&gt;From ALM to VaR&lt;/a&gt;. This is a thing that I
definitely have to understand better and the current location of the
industry and of the company in this dimension.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Important is as well to better understand that transition from
accounting values to market values. This is an entire very important
space that I have no clue about. Not so in line with my interests
cause I never liked too much accounting as a subject, but if you do
not understand that piece of the cake you might as well not loose time
in understanding all of the rest as everything starts from there.
&lt;/p&gt;

}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So writing a quick notes about this as I see a lot of confusion in my
broader team around this topic and want to make sense in this space
and create a bit of order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So basically the topic is around &lt;i&gt;full revaluation methods vs. factor
based revaluation methods&lt;/i&gt;. This was a bit the topic of the talk of the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-risk-valuation-methods/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>finance</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/on-risk-valuation-methods/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 13:39:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Solvency II</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/solvency-ii/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;style&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So after SST now the turn of Solvency II - the EU framework for
risk regulation of insurance companies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This will be important at the job as you need as well that framework
in order to compute the regulatory capital of the EU-based units.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top of it, it will be a good exercise to see SST in
perspective. It will also be good in order to understand what is
different between the two frameworks and possibly to better understand
how SST integrates with it and is compatible as claimed in the SST
whitepaper - with the argumentation that there should be a high degree
of compatibility, otherwise you can well imagine how one insurance
operating in one country would get a competitive advantage over the
other.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note as well that you have as well to understand better which
framework does apply where, when you start to have these weird
cross-border nested legal entities and relations. This will be
material of a different post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So time to learn a bit of SST and the concepts in this dimension.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I am running the thing it will make sense to have a broad
understanding of the thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It will give as well an understanding of some terms that you see going
around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sst/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (25 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>finance</category><category>insurance</category><guid>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sst/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 15:38:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Macro Variables and Financial Variables</title><link>https://marcohassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/macro-variables/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So here some notes about the macro side of the coin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started reading the &lt;a href="https://www.zurich.com/en/economics-and-markets/publications"&gt;weekly publications&lt;/a&gt; of the macro-group of
Zurich.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I must say that it is interesting. I always loved macro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I always recall the book of Blanchard. I think that this was the most
intersting theories I read throughout my academic life. Stat is
nice.. but way too much low level that higher world modeling dimension
is missing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I mean think Black-Scholes. That is also fun if I think about it now
again. A simple mathematical formula - confusing tons of
practitioners - through that stat low level stuff moving trillions of
dollars which is then ultimately resulting from very questionable
first-order assumptions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I am fascinated about how this world sticks together and is
not simply falling apart. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, back to Macroeconomics, at some point I thought that my life
was gonna be around it. &lt;i&gt;Kaynes vs. Hayek&lt;/i&gt; in an endless pointless
fight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that there is an inherent beauty in observing that
macro-picture making guesses about how the dots are connected.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Speculating on the reaction of CB etc. lovely. At the end they all
follow the common principles. Until the "business" does not require a
big shift.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any case here the list - which I guess will keep expanding in the
coming years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is important to understand all of these different components as if
you will stay for a long time in the industry and you will manage to
navigate data quickly some interesting patterns might start to emerge.
&lt;/p&gt;

So this is about a major trend in the insurance space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is one of the many posts in order to properly understand the
balance sheets of insurance companies that you will directly or
indirectly work with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a strong trend in structuring products that merge classical
insurance products with more traditional market-side investment
exposure in equties and bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is in fact what you invested in when doing your 3b plan via life
insurance. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what is a Market Risk System?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post tries to answer that question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This post aims to be the guide for your intrinsic motivation for
working on the system and should pose the basis for reaching higher
goals in your work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is important to have goals in life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is the same as in the field of mathematics. People say that once
you have a proper problem definition you are half-way through the
problem, everything else is sequential.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So let's define and let's hope then everything will be sequential
then. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Update as of 26/04/2022&lt;/i&gt; The above argumentation is correct but I
understand right now that the notes in this section are not based on
a risk model internally developed within the insurance
company. Rather, these are simple factor model representations of the
fixed income space used by the risk provider the company buys most of
the solution from.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Considering the fact that most of the risk providers copy each other I
suspect that these are in fact the very standard way of implementing
these models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution"&gt;following entry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that I am moving quite fast. Cannot spend too much time in each
and every detail as it is not the major component of my Job. I am just
quickly getting the high level idea of the model to represent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These notes suffer in this sense from this time pressure. In time they
will become more structured.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So recently I had an interview for a quantitative finance
position. I completely failed the preparation as it was not at all
about financial instruments but much more about econometrics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, here the notes I did for this preparation session. I
mainly prepared following &lt;a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/finance/the-50-market-risk-interview-questions-you-need-to-anticipate"&gt;these notes&lt;/a&gt; as I was told that one of the
interviewer would be of the market risk division.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it turned out that this is a super nice team but is much
more about times series and econometrics than classical market risk
theory as you are being taught in University.
&lt;/p&gt;
