So this post is about playing on brown-fields.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This should become one of the most important posts that you will
develop in your professional experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that people that worked on serious software projects that goes
a little bit beyond the calssical chatting level or idealist
discussion will agree on that: software projects are nasty. And here
my strong claim - software projects that are long lived are the most
nasty among them all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Funnily enough, it is much easier - and &lt;b&gt;satisfying&lt;/b&gt; - to develop a
solution from scratch, even if a pioneering solution, than to start
dealing and &lt;b&gt;entering as an outsider&lt;/b&gt; in a long lived project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is my new life. I am lucky to like challenges, cause otherwise it
would not be fun at all. But I was - by will or not - well tempered so
far in this dimension so I am happy to embrace a new challenge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post sets a little bit of context for the claim above and will
make the way for successfully dealing with these kind of projects -
the most easy to fail.
&lt;/p&gt;

The more I work on this project, the more sure I get. You need a
proper way to document your code structure. To jump into the source
base is otherwise extremly hard for freshies like me. On the top of it
given the amount of packages we need to maintain and expand I highly
doubt that it is efficient to not have such documentation. The time it
costs to go back and understand the general structure of the project,
even for the lead developer of the project is simply to high.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top of it, even a relative fresher into OOP as me, could find
some fundamental holes in the program logic here and there, in the
code base of a project. I must say that the developement of the
project is still ongoing, so I must check with the colleagues if they
are aware of such holes. In any case, I am pretty much sure that parts
of the fundamental holes result by a lack of high-level meta-overview
of the classes and interdependencies. Such holes may easily evolve in
such larger projects, that you touch across longer time horizons
without having the clear structure all of the time in your mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are missing the macro at some point the micro will reign and
the micro is usually nasty. The macro should lead your way of project
understanding. The micro should be just a modular low-level
intervention dictated by the macro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recall this. And work in such a way, otherwise things will come to
hunt back to you and your peace in future. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense I started quickly to explore for a couple of hours some
UML tools and their integration with the eclipse IDE.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes. I hope that in this sense I will have a proper
workflow in this dimension in the next couple of months.
&lt;/p&gt;
