The more I work on this project, the more sure I get. You need a
proper way to document your code structure. To jump into the source
base is otherwise extremly hard for freshies like me. On the top of it
given the amount of packages we need to maintain and expand I highly
doubt that it is efficient to not have such documentation. The time it
costs to go back and understand the general structure of the project,
even for the lead developer of the project is simply to high.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the top of it, even a relative fresher into OOP as me, could find
some fundamental holes in the program logic here and there, in the
code base of a project. I must say that the developement of the
project is still ongoing, so I must check with the colleagues if they
are aware of such holes. In any case, I am pretty much sure that parts
of the fundamental holes result by a lack of high-level meta-overview
of the classes and interdependencies. If you are missing the macro at
some point the micro will reign and the micro is usually nasty. The
macro should lead your way of project understanding. The micro should
be just a modular low-level intervention dictated by the macro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recall this. And work in such a way, otherwise things will come to
hunt back to you and your peace in future. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this sense I started quickly to explore for a couple of hours some
UML tools and their integration with the eclipse IDE.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes. I hope that in this sense I will have a proper
workflow in this dimension in the next couple of months.
&lt;/p&gt;
