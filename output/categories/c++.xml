Ok. This should be a lesson to you. I did quite some notes two years
ago when I was working with it. Also on object oriented programming
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then badaboom; I did not have this blog yet and did not save the notes
in the cloud. Turns out that two years later I will have to work a bit
in C++ for finishing my thesis and implementing everything into the
code. And badaboom; could not work with the previous notes and had to
start from scratch. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Plus I am upskilling my OOP knowledge and make it more theoretical. As
in one of the interviews I lost quite some points as I was not able to
answer quite basic questions of OOP but did not recall all of the
names semantics etc. and got under stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
