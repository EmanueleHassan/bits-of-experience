So I am starting to deliver some solutions on some minor features on
some applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There was quite a bit of work to be done in the last couple of
months. I mean I had to get up and running with Java, reverse engineer
some bit of application, write documentation etc. I am slowly getting
up to speed. I have still quite a few things on my mind and I guess
that to reach the point where I would like to be it will be another
6-12 months but I am moving at a &lt;i&gt;decent&lt;/i&gt; speed so that I am not
complaining too much.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The structure and challenges of the job gets clearer everyday so that
is fine - now it is a question of adapting and working strategically
to overcome the various issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next bit that is on the list is about testing. This post deals
with it. I am ready to get up and running with it and start to write
well-covered software. In a further step you can then imagine some
further integration with tools as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonarQube"&gt;sonarqube&lt;/a&gt; etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
