I still remember the time in Israel. This was the time I could sail
the best. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I did quite some theory about the sailing physics back then and when
going 3-4h a week for 6 months… then you really start to read the
things at their best. I remember I could see if the sails were
properly set just by seeing how the wind was flowing into them. I
could read telltales and the flapping of the sails from the different
angles. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After two years without practicing and checking at the theory
everything is gone. I noted though that in the last charter after one
week on the boat the concept were naturally coming back without even
too much of book study.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So here some notes about it - to let it stick into your mind and refresh it
from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sailing-on-some-bits-of-experience/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>sailing</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sailing-on-some-bits-of-experience/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 08:26:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sails Types</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sails-types/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
So here a post where you store the different sail types.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You also keep a record of when and how different should be used and
the scope and idea of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sails-types/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>sailing</category><guid>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sails-types/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 17:46:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sailing - Venturi/Bernoulli Effect</title><link>https://emanuelehassan.github.io/bits-of-experience/posts/sailing-venturi-effect/</link><dc:creator>Marco Hassan</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
So I have to render my sailing notes digital.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Otherwise I will loose them in time and I will not be able to withdraw
them in the future anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this is a legacy stuff migration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By now I do everything digitally and everything flows directly more
less into this blog such that I can archive and withdraw it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the past it did not used to be the case and now you are paying the
price for it. You want to pay it though as sailing is supposed to be
your main leisure in the coming decades such that it makes sense to
organize your material relating to it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So this post treats the venturi-effect. This is the ultimate effect
why you are able to sail against the wind and still move in the
direction where the wind is coming.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is also the same effect that planes use to take off and stay high
up in the air. Helicopters also use it as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So it is a nice concept to understand also when you fly and highly in
use in lots of this mechanical physics based stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
