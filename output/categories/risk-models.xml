So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Update as of 26/04/2022&lt;/i&gt; The above argumentation is correct but I
understand right now that the notes in this section are not based on
a risk model internally developed within the insurance
company. Rather, these are simple factor model representations of the
fixed income space used by the risk provider the company buys most of
the solution from.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Considering the fact that most of the risk providers copy each other I
suspect that these are in fact the very standard way of implementing
these models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution"&gt;following entry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that I am moving quite fast. Cannot spend too much time in each
and every detail as it is not the major component of my Job. I am just
quickly getting the high level idea of the model to represent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These notes suffer in this sense from this time pressure. In time they
will become more structured.
&lt;/p&gt;
