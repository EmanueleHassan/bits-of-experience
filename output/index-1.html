A strong orchestrator tool that operates above the container level and
allows to manage a cluster to handle containers.
</p>

<p>
It is essentially the tool set that lets you manage containers.
</p>

<p>
Enterprises can use it to manage the life cycle of containerized apps
in a cluster of nodes, which is a collection of worker machines such
as virtual machines (VMs) or physical machines.
</p>

<p>
In general kubernetes try to leverage clusters in order to avoid
having a single point of failure.

Microservices refer to an application architectural style that divides
an application into components, where each component is a full, but
miniature, application that is focused on producing a single business
task.
</p>

<p>
Each microservice has a well-defined interface and dependencies (to
other microservices and to external resources) so that it can run
fairly independently, and the team can develop it fairly
independently.
</p>

<p>
Microservices enable developers to accomplish meaningful work working
in small teams. Small teams allow developers to be more productive
because they spend less time in meetings and decrease the need for
communication and coordination that is needed with a large team.

<p>
The basic idea of Docker is to allow the possibility to save all of
the configuration of an application in one single image. This should
be considered as a safe environment that once properly set up can be
easily shared among different teams and once images are instantiated
all of the different teams can be sure to operate and leverage the
right configuration for running their application.
</p>

<p>
A simple and straight forward overview about the advantage of Docker
might be found in this sense at <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker_architecture.htm">docker architecture</a>.
</p>

<p>
To sum up before starting the basic idea is to create images and to
create containers based on that, which will run then the application
as defined in the docker image.

So here are some notes about some useful commands in git.
</p>

<p>
I might start to use it again from the command line as magit in my
emacs is dead slow on Windows OS.
</p>

<p>
I read online that there are some fundamental issues with it on
Windows.
</p>

<p>
This is not the only program where I am experiencing some performance
hiccup on Windows systems.
</p>

<p>
I will switch back to Mac soon as it seems that here in the company
they started to offer the possibility to have one. Have to wait a
couple of months for it still as I have to wait for the migration of
the IT systems to the cloud to have proper access to everything
without having to manually make new auth-modules.

This second post present the basic set up of a Spark session and goes
over the basic of creating Spark RDDs, the first-class citizens of
Spark. An RDD is a <code>Resilient Distributed Dataset</code>. It is Resilient as
it can be recomputed if cluster failures happens. It is distributed as
an RDD can be distributed among cores and machines. And it is finally
a dataset.
</p>

<p>
RDDs are saved in-memory by default. Nonetheless when the memory of
the machine is not sufficient to handle the data, RDDs are splitted to
disk.
</p>

<p>
Finally this post outlines a bit the difference among RDDs and
DataFrames and tries to clarify that.

Paredit is a nice tool to quickly deal with parenthesis when
coding. Thorough simple commands it lets you easily edit content
wrapped in parenthesis, move quickly the parenthesis themselves

This post aims at providing an overview of the necessary steps
required in order to leverage Apache Spark through the Python API and
the PySpark module.
</p>

<p>
Despite the information is vastly reported over the internet my usual
<i>procedere</i> when I deal with new tools and software is to write a
short piece of note when learning new software that is intended as an
overview over the tool and serve as a beginner cheat sheet.

So recently I had an interview for a quantitative finance
position. I completely failed the preparation as it was not at all
about financial instruments but much more about econometrics.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, here the notes I did for this preparation session. I
mainly prepared following <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/finance/the-50-market-risk-interview-questions-you-need-to-anticipate">these notes</a> as I was told that one of the
interviewer would be of the market risk division.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it turned out that this is a super nice team but is much
more about times series and econometrics than classical market risk
theory as you are being taught in University.

This is another of the posts that is likely to increase in time.
</p>

<p>
More concepts will flow in here and it will become more complete in
time.
</p>

<p>
This is what I actually miss from my first Masters - I was not working
in a digital way at the times. This is a pity cause lots of this
knowledge is gone in a non-consummable way. There were quite a few
handy things that I could use as mental frameworks at my current job….
</p>

<p>
Would be cool at some time to time to take some time and integrate
there the concepts in the different relevant posts for the particular
category.
</p>

<p>
In any case have a look <a href="https://thismatter.com/">at this</a>… just read an article there and it
was well written and it seems to be an interesting project where to
have a look at once in a while… layout aside of course… I mean
checked a bit again and I have to say that at times it is quite
coarse.. but that is what you mean once in a while and then you can
check at the things in more detail…

Ok. This should be a lesson to you. I did quite some notes two years
ago when I was working with it. Also on object oriented programming
etc.
</p>

<p>
Then badaboom; I did not have this blog yet and did not save the notes
in the cloud. Turns out that two years later I will have to work a bit
in C++ for finishing my thesis and implementing everything into the
code. And badaboom; could not work with the previous notes and had to
start from scratch. 
</p>

<p>
Plus I am upskilling my OOP knowledge and make it more theoretical. As
in one of the interviews I lost quite some points as I was not able to
answer quite basic questions of OOP but did not recall all of the
names semantics etc. and got under stress.
