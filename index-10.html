So here are some notes on concepts you have to use when working in a
proper OOP way.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, I had written some notes about major OOP
concepts. Unfortunately it got lost. Learn your lesson from it as this
is a real pity.
</p>

<p>
In any case start anew here. Basically this should cover a little bit
of Software Design best practices. Add some notes for instance through
the following sources
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns">design-patterns and refactoring</a> - online source.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf">desing patterns</a> - apparently <i>THE BOOK</i> in order to write proper
software .</li>
</ul>
<p>
So when you read the book it is immediate that the design patterns
ultimately depend on the OOP concepts, such as composition,
inheritance, delegation etc. So basically these are the atoms of OOP
and patterns are based on such atoms. So in the book you start from
the atoms. Otherwise it makes sense to read a separate book completely
dedicated to it, such as: <i>Object-Oriented Thought Process</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is a good investement learning such patterns. You will be then much
better able to decompose the existing applications. This will help you
to navigate big existing legacy applications where no description of
it is attached to it.

This in the sense that you will understand better the deployment of
application. Server side operations etc. for the Java world.

So I quickly took time to fix the Python issue. I could first download
just the portable version of it due to security issues.
</p>

<p>
But then it was just a pain to configure pip and to get all of the
proper configuration to work with virtualenvironments.
</p>

<p>
I also did not want to live like a moroon and not work with virtual
environments knowing that it will come to hit me back at some
point. Plus when the transition to the cloud will be completed and a
more solid microservices approach will be in place it will be
essential to have virtual environments for having all of the needed
dependencies for each project and just load these into your docker
image/container.
</p>

<p>
The same holds for these very heavy and ugly solutions such as conda
and friends.

So having moved out of the field of PoC/MvP I must say that I am
starting to understand the difficulties around setting up virtuous
enterprise applications.
</p>

<p>
You have complex processes and lots of possible solutions. You have to
be agile and nimble. This is the only way to manage the complexity and
still be able to steer your application in a smooth way, in order to
keep up with the technological progress.
</p>

<p>
This is the ultimate challenge of the job. The complex business logic
calls for complex solutions. I.e. usually when you are under pressure
you make direct mappings of the required business logic into a
system. Without abstracting and without imposing meta-structure the
system gets heavy and looses that nimble and agile component.
</p>

<p>
In order to deal with the issues above, I started to read <a href="http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/97-98/2/ce418-1/resources/root/Books/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture%20-%20Martin%20Fowler.pdf">Patterns of
Enterprise Application Architecture</a>, here some notes -mainly copy and
past - such that I will hopefully learn in a fast way to make the
right decisions when working on enterprise applications.

So this is an interesting post. It treats some financial model for
fixed income instruments.
</p>

<p>
At school, back in the days you simply treated the standard
duration/convexity and simpler refined models thinking in terms of
key-rate duration etc.
</p>

<p>
I never specialized in fixed income instruments during my
studies. More on volatility models, general econometrics and
derivatives if any. So it makes sense that the models you checked at
in the more general non-specialized modules, were quite general.
</p>

<p>
Now working in an insurance you understand well that fixed-income
instruments take the lion position.
</p>

<p>
Hence, more specialized models are used in order to price the risk of
such fixed-income instruments.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update as of 26/04/2022</i> The above argumentation is correct but I
understand right now that the notes in this section are not based on
a risk model internally developed within the insurance
company. Rather, these are simple factor model representations of the
fixed income space used by the risk provider the company buys most of
the solution from.
</p>

<p>
Considering the fact that most of the risk providers copy each other I
suspect that these are in fact the very standard way of implementing
these models.
</p>

<p>
Here some notes to understand the things in this sense in a better
way. The general idea is to use fixed-income attribution models as in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution">following entry</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that I am moving quite fast. Cannot spend too much time in each
and every detail as it is not the major component of my Job. I am just
quickly getting the high level idea of the model to represent.
</p>

<p>
These notes suffer in this sense from this time pressure. In time they
will become more structured.

Ok, so this is a post in line with the previous ones. You are starting
to understand your responsibilities and how the team operates.
</p>

<p>
It is going to be a fun ride. Let's see how it will go in the long
run.
</p>

<p>
Here are some notes that will be your northern star in your new
adventure. They should always be fresh in your mind as they will help
you to keep the right amount of serenity at work and to work in the
best possible way given your limited amount of time and mental
resources.

Wow.. things are starting to get interesting. The issue is that in the
new job, you do not simply have to tackle down a system that looks
challenging to tackle down, with lots of tech involved and, possibly,
a fair amount of math.
</p>

<p>
You have as well to deal with a business machine that is equally
complex. The organization and the structure of the entire machine
is interesting.
</p>

<p>
In order to well perform at the job a good understanding of both is
necessary. So I am taking a bit of time now to structure the
understing in this dimension and to understand how the investment
management machine works in bigger insurance companies.
</p>

<p>
Note that I am keeping these notes very general and I am just writing
here publicly available information. These notes mainly derive on the
public document outling the structure of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbpPqt5eXzAhVE_KQKHdhmA_YQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;url=https://www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/investment-management-value-creation-2014.pdf?la=en&amp;usg=AOvVaw2m5DSA7AYGq9OfYan1QB7h">zurich insurance investment
management</a>, which is very well in line with what I can observe in my
position.
</p>

<p>
In order to expand your understanding in this sense, you can <a href="https://www.oecd.org/investment/evolution-insurer-strategies-long-term-investing.pdf">read the
following document by oecd</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that such a general macro-view is necessary as through it you
will make better sense on the applicaiton of your market-risk system
and can better understand the stakeholder you will have to deal with.

So in this post I will make some notes on Gradle.
</p>

<p>
I could theoretically take it as a black box at work and do my work
with the current configuration.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to invest some time to understand how it works under the
hood. This will allow me more flexibility in the future. Moreover, it
will allow me to streamline my workflow in emacs once I have a more
profund understanding of it.
</p>

<p>
These notes are based on the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gradle-Action-Benjamin-Muschko/dp/1617291307">gradle in action</a>. Interesting is
that this book works with Groovy, which is apparently a more flexible
Java that introduce some of the concepts of dynamic programming
languages. Look at the <a href="https://www.bbvaapimarket.com/en/api-world/why-groovy-gaining-popularity-among-java-developers/">following entry</a> in this sense. I must say that
I can well understand why Python is gaining so much traction over more
heavy languages as Java. It is not simply a thing about the learning
curve. I think that Java with its structured type-safe and OOP
appraoch is more solid than Python for larger system. I see the point
for using it at work. The only thing is that the developing experience
is slower. As you have to compile the entire code before running it,
you cannot develop on the fly and integrate the changes in the more
structured project as you used to do in interpreted languages.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, back to the book. Note that the book is very exhaustive.
Through it you will manage to get a broad overview on the topic and
you will even get to the point of continous integration and continouos
deployment.
