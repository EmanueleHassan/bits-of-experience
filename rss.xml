One especially interesting feature that I already used before; but
unfortunately I did not make notes for, is the possibility of
specifying particular functions via the PySpark raw API and make them
available throughout your spark session when working via data-frames -
be it via SparkSQL or via pandas.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that this notes are based on &lt;a href="https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/content/spark-sql-udfs.html"&gt;this source&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like a very
exhaustive source. So check at it again should this project really
start. There you might make sense of all of that.

This are some notes on Helm.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I have downloaded a chart. I will have to change the
configurations of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will have to configure static IP for the internal application
running in kubernetes such that my service will be externally
accessible. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here some notes based on that and some commands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will expand on this in the future depending how much I will have to
work with it.

Some general notes on data lakes. Sum up a bit the general decisions
in the data world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
More interesting is the Zaloni approach discussed later in the notes.

&lt;p&gt;
This entry contains some notes about setting up a CI pipeline. I will
explore especially the &lt;code&gt;Jenkins&lt;/code&gt; option and I will integrate it with
Python.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After setting up the architecture for a project it is important now to
set up such processes such that we will work with the proper tooling
and will not loose too much time integrating versions over time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please note that some of this material comes from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Continuous-Integration-Delivery-Examples/dp/1484242807"&gt;Python Continuous
Integration and Delivery: A Concise Guide with Examples&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can refer to this book should you want a more in depth discussion
of the material covered here.

Ok, it turns out I will have also quickly to dig into RDFs its syntax
and concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To be honest after I digged deeper into label-property graphs I do not
really see the point of using RDFs graphs and query such graphs via
SPARQL. I did not even start seriously with it and I already have
headache because of the complexity involved. In every little thing in
CS there are layers and layers of complexity and at least 10 ways to
do one thing. That does not help. w3c or whatever should improve on
this, cause it is not fun like this. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any case, after this quick rant, the point of learning this is that
RDF is useful in itself cause on top of allowing the construction of
RDF graphs and the query via SPARQL it is a w3c standard to store
triples in itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Standardizations are always good, and this is why such data syntax is
very much used across the world for a smooth data transfer. I.e. even
if you do not like the graph storage and query of such RDF data, it is
useful itself cause its large community endowment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is why for the solution we will leverage existing RDF ontologies
as well as create our own data store following RDF standards and a
particular RDF ontology format used in Switzerland.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the lower data layer we will therefore work with these. The app
logic, store and retrieve will likely not be through RDFs graphs and SPARQL.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is just another quick note for myself. I also set it in my
org-agenda as a reminder. I believe in this piece of advice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This morning I was doing some research exploring the data science
consulting vs. in house data science world and what people usually
say in merit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One reddit leads to the other and at the end I quickly was off
track. I ended up on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mc77r3/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_pursue_your_own/"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.

So new project new life. The one before did not take off due to
bureaucratic issues - a pity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Good is that on the new one I will work with Graph Databases. I love
graph structures and I deeply believe in them so I am very happy to
start this project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This posts summarizes my learning encounters when working with graph
databases and sets some mental structure for working with them.
&lt;/p&gt;

The time has come. It is the moment to start learning javascript. This
is a quite fundamental technology. No need to tell you why. Everyone
knows it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For a project I might use &lt;code&gt;Node.js&lt;/code&gt;. We will decide next week
but in the meanwhile I will take 1-2h now to explore javascript. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that these notes, are mainly taken from Javascript the Definitive
Guide - 7th edition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all it is quite standard and easy. The only particular thing is
the asynchronous javascript. But after your course on distributed
systems algo it should be no difficulty to make sense of all of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a must know language as being it the programming language of
the web and with the rise of &lt;code&gt;Node.js&lt;/code&gt; that brought it also out of the
web into the backend it is by now the most used programming language
among Software Developers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Update end of March - this project did not take of due to bureaucratic
issues. Good is that for the next project I have the decision on the
entire architecture and it turns out that I will also have to deal a
bit with the front-end. So it was indeed a good idea to learn
Javascript. Talked with a colleague that introduced my to Angular
architecture. I mean I will never learn it at a level to write code in
it as front-end is not my bread but at least I will be able to
navigate and read the code and get an idea of how the front-end operates.
&lt;/p&gt;

Personal Opinion. I think that the Epic Games - Apple dispute is big.
